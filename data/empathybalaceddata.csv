"That's pretty vague, do you not know what you're doing in regards to a specific section of your life? Like school or work?",0
"idk what a Red pill means exactly but my advice to you is if she treating you right then fuck her there are billions of other girls out there, and if u feel like in love with her and just leave her then try to not care and you have to accept the fact that some girls(as well as some guys) will lie straight to your face for years without any remorse. my advice is stop caring before too late.",0
"I think it's social anxiety , that creates paranoid feelings , unless I'm wrong but that's how I feel",1
"By any chance do you think you're in a loop. Junk food can make you depressed. And being depressed probably makes you eat more junk food? For a while that was my problem too. Even if its just random, ill probably binge and feel bad later. Only to indulge in more later to try to cheer up.",1
"depression. not sadness which is caused by something and is healthy. Depression is an actual mental disorder which commonly goes untreated. The best things you can do for depression is first of all, not hiding it, tell your loved ones so they can help you. also get a therapist, very helpful and help you cope with depression and get over it. If you think really bad you can see a doctor and see if medication is a good idea. I take antidepressants and my depression is gone, it change you like I originally thought it would, it just makes me the same but not sad all the time.",1
That's why I'm repeating 11th grade. It sucks.,0
"Ask your school counselor what resources they can give you. Just go into the office, ask for the counselor, and see what they've got.",0
Is that really so bad? Maybe it was the smart decision because you needed that time to read recover. You're being kind to yourself when you need it and that's important. Hope you feel better soon.,1
Why can't you get a job as a lawyer?,0
"I don't want you to jump. I don't want you to die, in either one. I don't know exactly what you're going through but from the sounds of it, I'd suggest focusing on the parts in your life that you enjoy.",1
"It's not uncommon. Bipolar can be very difficult to diagnose. We tend to think of it as a constant swinging between high and low but really you can be low all the time and still be bipolar if you had one high at some point. What you do is move forward with your new diagnosis and work on treatment and coping skills. ADHD and depression are generally easier to manage long term than bipolar disorder, so that's a plus.",0
Expecting people to stop being depressed like turning off a light is extremely stupid.,0
"sorry to hear that, but been in a similar situation after taking some time off of school. My best advice is to take the minimum amount of classes possible so you get too overwhelmed. For me essential to plan my assignments in advance, so that I can just do things one by one and not let it all get piled up cuz then I wanna die. Also, if you need a break, take one. School will always be there but good to take care of yourself too :)",1
"The generic answers heard over the years tend to go something like the following; exercise, sunlight, talking, therapy, stroking animals, eating healthily, meditation and writing one thing thankful for daily. I say with sincerity that any of those have worked for me but helped others. Keeping busy with hobbies on the days able to function might help. It does slightly for me.",1
"Hey, just wait it out. I know what you feel. Sometimes I think I'm attractive, and sometimes I can't even look at myself I'm so disgusted. I've come to realize it's all just a fucked up mind game I play with myself. I doubt you're actually that ugly, you're probably kinda cute honestly, but if you're anything like me, you've tricked yourself into thinking you're ugly. If you want people to want to be around you, you have to do some basic things like showering, putting on actual clothes, smiling, excercising a little and pretending you have confidence. It's honestly dumb, but these things can be hard to do, especially if you struggle with low confidence and depression. But if you take care of yourself, it's not too hard to find people. And just you wait until you find a person to kiss on New Years, because the feeling is worth the wait. I know this is all a bit corny, but if you ever wanna talk about anything I'd be more than happy to :)",1
No amount of 'you are not alone's from internet randos who won't reach out to you after will help. My local mental health system is an absolute joke and often made me more suicidal. So I also am alone when in crisis.,1
at least you got people trying to comfort you. I even dont have that. Again there are people who got it Much worse,1
"Does there need to be a reason? Depression is an illness, and like any other illness it doesn't need some form of justification, it just *is*",0
"You're a good man, Median. I hope you know this. I hope that you have people around you that will tell your story for centuries, and that you live on as a hero in the minds of newer generations. But, I'd rather you live, personally.",1
"Thats totally normal, most people get that from time to time. It will pass, the when is the real question. Good news is you can work on the when, at least it works for me. I think the key is to accept whatever you are feeling, not fight it and not try to change it, even try to get yourself to cry. The point is really to change your mindset from 'i have depression i can't cure it, it is killing me' to 'i'm sad again for no reason, human brain is a pile of shit and buggy as hell, I'm gonny cry all day to give it what it wants'..",1
Yes you are right from my experience.Not dealing with my problems. I isolated my family. It just came second nature.When they don't understand me.I kept busy on the shitty computer to avoid my problems. I realize that the worst thing i could have done. I need to try harder and put my family first who means everything to me.,1
I don't really think life is he'll but I don't understand the weird sadness or fear of death that people have. I've known a few people who died. I wasn't sad at all. Everyone I know is going to die and one day I am going to die. Why is that sad?,1
"No friends here, willing to listen. Need someone to listen to me sometime too. I'm going to bed right now, but if you want to message me I will get back to you tomorrow.",1
"ive just sat in my room crying my eyes out thinking mostly about this. Conversations with people ive known my whole life i find difficult, its not natural. Everything feels so forced! im sick of trying so so hard to look normal. I hide my feelings from absolutely everyone and im exhausted. No motivation in life, feel like im a waste of skin",1
"Omgosh. I just want to validate this feeling because I have been there. That said, if it's a matter of safety, there is no question. You know that you need to go. You just do it. It's not some kind of failure. You are taking care of yourself. It DOES super suck though. Don't let anyone tell you it's all fine and fun to go through that. I've been there. I've come out the other end and been okay for long periods too though so I mean, it doesn't stay like that. Hang on. It gets better.",1
Write here one good memory of something nice happened recently.,0
What were you taking before vs what are you taking now? Are you being prescribed by your general doctor or a psychiatrist? Do you feel like you are in danger right now?,0
"I'm down in that hole. Don't get sucked in is my advice. You'll get nothing good out of it. The thing with alcohol is that, once you start drinking too much, too often, the idea that it makes you feel better is entertained while it is not true at all. It's: *I drink to forget, but I've drank so much I don't know what it is I have to forget. So I drink, just to be sure.* Alcohol and drugs have become a habit for me and I can't really live without them anymore. I need them to maintain a level of tolerable shittiness - but trust me, I'd be way less miserable if I never started it.",1
"Thought I was ok and it passed away for half a year, but now it is coming back, and it hits twice as bad as before.",1
"Get up and take a shower, and then go for a walk so you can clear your mind. That usually helps me after going through one of these periods. It sucks, but you'll get through it. And don't lose your job, you don't want to end up on the street. You're stronger than you think, there's just a cloud of depression around you that's obscuring your vision. Stay strong and don't give up. You can do this.",1
well not for nothing but you made it extremely difficult to read your post by only using a period in the title. JUST saying not judging.,0
i used to. rn im in the area of not going to sleep so tmrw doesn't come,1
I mean fastest way is a pawnshop or trading stuff into GameStop,0
"If I had any will to do something good, I'd be doing it.",0
"Okay, so feeling shitty is necessarily a shitty feeling. But, even subconscious you is empathetic and cares about others, which is a beautiful fuckin' thing to be. It's why you have the capacity to feel so bad, and it's also why you can (if you want to) be an amazing resource for people. Being able to feel things as deeply as you or I can is something to be cherished and protected and put to good use. The world could use more empathy, you know? It's okay to hate yourself too, btw. Just be honest with yourself about your good traits as well, yeah? &lt;3",0
"Each day repeats with the only change is it gets worse, preach man.",0
"Pain's pain. There's no point in comparing our suffering to someone else's. Depression doesn't demand that you have a good reason. On a surface level, there's a lot about my life that people would even be jealous of, but that doesn't make me any less miserable. You're the only one living your own experience, no one else can say whether or not it warrants pain. If you feel something, you feel something",0
"Treat yourself to some body lotion, chocolate icecream and maybe a glass of wine while you're at it. Couldn't ask for a more relaxing weekend than that.",0
"I care, man. Hang in there, things will get better eventually.",1
"Dude. broken my arm so bad that I needed a titanium rod. I was in hospital for 5 days. Let me tell you that it was the most depressing and humiliating thing ever. I was in a ward with a man who was dying from pancreatic cancer and another one who was about to have his legs amputated because of diabetes. It is absolutely miserable seeing them alone throughout the entire day waiting for a visit and sometimes they have anyone come over at all. Furthermore, the medical staff were stretched so thin that I had to scream and bear unspeakable pain for 45 minutes before I could get my shot of painkillers. This was after they had attached the rods to my arm. Oh and last but not least, absolutely humiliating to use the restroom or shower. I understand and appreciate the efforts the medical staff commit but I really help but feel embarrassed when they shower me or escort me to the restroom. wish to be admitted to the hospital. EVER.",1
Mine is coming up and I am generally indifferent to it. I told my family I don't want to do anything for it.,1
Congrats on your birthday. I've never thought as well that i might see my HS graduation this year.,1
Maybe one day things will become brighter for you to see it in a better light so that dream job might be ideal,1
How did the trauma come about?,0
I hope you're still here. It gets better.,1
"If there's one thing I regret not doing, it's that I didn't kill myself when I was 12 and actually attempted it. It's been all downhill in the 15 years since.",1
a motorcycle ride sounds super cool. i can't even force myself on my bike.,0
I'm trying to increase my self worth so I stop doing this exact thing. My frustration immediately gets taken out on the one thing I seem to hate the most: me. I've started to set small goals for myself every day so each day feels like a success when I achieve those goals. This has led me to branch out and actually put myself out there. In doing so I'm discovering a passion for mental health advocacy and rekindling a love for doing creative stuff. I'm not saying everything has immediately gotten better. Holy shit it hasn't. But this helps at least a little for me! Hope you can find omething that works for you. Let me know if you wanna talk about it,1
The good is worth it! Hang in there! You can get through this because you're stronger than this! You can make it through cause the good will be worth it! Lots of love!,1
i guess the idea is that have something strong enough to motivate you towards it. I personally have goals but I never have so I really help you here.,0
What does that mean in practice? Are you one of those persons who got tired of being used so now you use others?,0
Please know that someone out there cares for you and would be heartbroken if you here.,1
"When I read this, I had to think of a girl in our company. I saw her like 2-3 days a week, always with a sad face. So, one day I just asked her, if everything is allright. She said Yes, of course, thanks. How about you? I answered with I'm fine. But I don't believe you. If you're ok, why can't you smile for just... one moment? She said: ... I never knew, that it was that obviously. No one ever told me that. I answered: I guess plenty of people know that something isn't ok with you, but most people just care about their own shit or just don't know what to say. If you wanna talk... I'm here. She ended the dialouge with Thank you.... And she never wrote me again since then. I felt bad somehow. On the one hand, I just wanted to help, but she refused it somehow or I scared her too much. On the other hand... maybe I just made it worse for her, and that's of course not what I wanted. The human mind is a thing, no one can explain. It's infinite.",1

"No time to find link right now, but Sarah Silverman said exactly this in her interview with Terry Gross on Fresh Air a few months ago.",1
"I was like this at 16-18 all I wanted to do was sit in front of my computer and not leave the house. It wasn't like I was actually doing anything productive but on youtube / games I was just rotting and completely ok with it because it stopped me feeling that deep void inside and the negative voice. I am now 28. Iv'e managed to find a little bit more of a balance between technology and life but I am still depressed and cycle in and out of this. I would look into an addiction though, it is possible to be addicted to electronics (especially gaming and the internet). If you feel like you're agitated and your depression is linked into computer usage you might want to consider that your depression and negativity is linked into an addiction.",1
I have the opposite problem. I eat and eat and eat when depressed. Sometimes when I have bad anxiety I eat though.,0
"very cool accomplishments! a photographer as well, love to see some of your work if you wanna share. at the end of last year my girlfriend of two and a half years left me, i had to move back home with my parents and lost all but one of my friends. but it pushed me to finally come out as trans and get hormone therapy. one year later and i feel like myself for the first time in 22 years. a few months ago i stood up to my shithead boss and quit my job working repossession. i really miss the money but miss slaving away for 80 hours a week and now looking into getting a job dreamed of since i was in highschool. sometimes things really do happen for a reason.",1
I feel the same way. I'm angry and depressed. It takes a lot out of me emotionally to do little things like run errands. I hate interacting with people. They state at me funny and act like I'm scary which makes me angry. It's exhausting.,1
Personally I hate Christmas and all the Christmas spirit crap.,0
I just feel like I don't have a purpose. Like while I need things to survive. The things I need don't need me.,1
I was close to doing this so many times.,1
I'm here. I'll try to help.,1
"I felt this EXACT way when I first went as well. I felt like it was a grilling of my life, and I even tried to lie and say that I'm mostly 100% happy with my life and that I just wish I had more friends and cleaned the house more. YEAH RIGHT. I'm a mess a lot of the time and have so many problems I dont know where to begin. Eventually once I started to know my therapist and dive into the smaller issues, did she really start to open up and I opened up myself as well. Keep going. The first day is the hardest I think",1
One of my old therapists used to tell me that these were still considered suicidal thoughts even though I actively planning to do anything. I always told her it was just wishful thinking. Lol.,1
"My current goal is to outlive everyone that cares about me. It seems like the nicest thing I can do for them, and it also grants me a chance to figure stuff out. All of my self-preservation instincts are driven off of the pain I would cause loved ones if something were to happen to me, in all situations, and that fear is what keeps me going during the worst of it. If you can't do it for yourself, try to carry on for someone you care about.",0
It really is one of the worst feelings. My dog who was my best friend for 6 years was just gone one day when I got home. That was about two years ago and I still miss my buddy,1
"I'm sorry, my friend. I lost my mum too, two years ago. I feel your pain but it'll get better for you, I promise.",1
"You got it all wrong. You should be looking forward to making more of those happy days, if you force yourself to be sad simply because you know you're depressed, you'll never get over it ever. Hang onto those days and strive to make more happy days each month. Depression is fed from negative thought process, let it starve",0
"Everything is pointless, all our feelings are illusions because they are all brain chemicals. I don't see any meaning in life, there is no purpose, no happiness, no satisfaction. Why being happy/wanting to live is the normal quality of a human? Can't depressed be normal too? Is depression real?",0
"What I can say that I can relate somewhat to your situation. Upholding social standard is hard and especially hard is keeping in line with what your family wants from you. You need to be able to find joy in new things, in what you find interesting currently, even if it isn't exactly accepted socially and your family might not like it. It's your life, not your parent's.",1
"Not in the same way - I have a job (and prospects), I have some friends, but I live a life in solitude, since I cannot enjoy spending time with friends or people because it amplifies my depression - and I have no clue why. Maybe because I always feel alone, even when in company which makes me avoid it. So yeah, it's not what I'd call a life worth living and at least somehow related to your struggle.",0
"Back at my old job, I used sick leave.",1
"I think it's more like...suicide IS selfish, but so is asking someone to not commit suicide. So the argument is just kind of invalid because it's merely a question of who gets to be selfish.",0
"Same, well obviosuly I don't know how you feel 100% but I thinks its appropiate to say I can relate to you deeply. Why don't we try distract ourselves, even if its just 5 mins. Listen to a song you like, watch a small video, browse r/eyebleach or even go drink water. Im gonna try and watch something in youtube to at least try and not think about you know what. Wannna try with me? :)",1
"It took me seven years to get a bachelors, and a lot of that was done part time or online. Do it on your schedule. Nobody else's.",1

Revenge. . . On a life thrown away.,0
"Well yeah, but what about the relatives and the mess?",0
"Hellow, is bad to hear that you're doing bad, I feel kinda the same, don't kill yourself, you're going to die anyway, so try and enjoy as much as you can. I hate how my life is right now, I feel empty and bored with everything/everyone, but.. **I love being alive**, you know, even tho existence itself has no meaning, we can just try and take the best out of it as long as we can.",1
"Happy birthday bud :) Being a Virgo has its perks... this isn't one of them. Always a perfectionist, never happy with anything. I feel you man.. tomorrow is my birthday.",0
same man I feel you,1
"Sounds like apathy to me. I'm guessing you feel kind of lost and without a direction and you just are following the path that you feel is required of you. While apathy is one symptom of depression, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have depression. By no means am I downplaying depression or trying to convince you that nothing is wrong because there isn't any on true definition of depression. I felt like you for a while, just a few small pleasures but nothing really else. For me, it went away after a few months. If you want to talk about it more or anything, feel free to ask anything. My only advice is don't give up now, because if it goes away, you'll regret a lot of things that you stopped caring about.",1
"Really depends on the particular medication. Everyone responds differently as well. I have mostly had bad experiences with antidepressants, but I am not a good example. I know people who really improved while being on them. It is a bit of a gamble and it can take time to find the suitable med for you. I would say it is worth a try though.",1
"Depressed since I was 9, I'm 23 now...I totally feel you, you are not alone. Thankfully life does seem to get better for each year that passes, I deal with the severe depression as it occurs and try to enjoy the times when it's milder. Good luck to you in life.",1
Late at night is pretty much the only time I feel normal. Too bad I waste most of the night on sleep.,1
"As someone who's felt the same, what do you have? And I'm speaking objectively, because I typically don't want to admit that I have what I need when I feel as you do. Not that I'm saying that you do have a lot, but your post doesn't necessarily shed a lot of light on what's going on. It's easy, or it has been for me, at least, to say that I don't know what to live for, in the past. Somebody out there cares, man/woman, small or large. I don't know what your situation is, by your post, but feel free to message me if you want.",1
"You deserve it! No one does! should yourself, though. Try to roll with it instead of beating yourself down more. You could comfort yourself instead and see what that does.",1
Will pray for you my friend. Pray lift these things and issues up to God. Pray without ceasing. Put your faith and trust in the Lord that he would help you overcome these issues and struggles. I wish you the very best. God bless you my friend.,0
"YOU ARE NOT ALONE!!!! You posting here proves that. No matter what give up. There is always a better day, a better year, and a better life. There is so much help waiting for you. Talk it all out here if you need to, we judge and we can all relate. Please rob the world of your life! PM if you need help or need to talk, always willing to!",1
"Exactly. Don't worry OP it will be ok, if one of your conversations got awkward just shrug it off, it doesn't fucking matter. If you see someone alone , go talk to them. If everyone is in a group just be like hey guys what's sup , again don't try to be weird just be yourself. People will accept you I promise. It's best if you try taking to one person, it has much better results so go do your thing",0
"Yea, things go more wrong when happy. Kind of. Really I just get more nervous because I suddenly have that happiness to lose. When Im depressed it is what it is, but when like carrying a bag of money through a bad neighbourhood at let me lose lol. I be happy if not risking something. The risk and fear of losing the happiness, is part of how I feel good. Like, I feel proud that willing to take that risk. If that makes sense? Be careful with music, powerful. I have stuff I listen to because so good at effecting how I feel. Also, your brain releases a lot of chemicals when happy for the first time in a while, if ever had an extreme sugar rush, or done cocaine lol, it can be overwhelming. normal though.",1
"Replace cutting with something else. When you wanna cut do something else. I smoke haha but seriously maybe theres other things that you might enjoy. Before I lost all motivation for anything I used to like running till my body hurt. It releases endorphins and other good stuff. I can vouch, I felt good afterwards.",1
"Depression is a hard fight. I am 29, on meds and I still struggle. All I can add is to start with yourself. Keep a daily routine, like hygiene or reading, find something that allows you to clear your mind and be calm. Go to work or go to school and be yourself. Always find something that can make you laugh. A great sense of humor and a good personality can for real change the way people see you. I had terrible acne as a child and hated how I looked, but as I grew older I gained more friends through my humor. I only really have 2 friends but they are great friends. Quality over quantity and all that jazz. As for being single I too am in the double digit bus. I go from periods of loathing being alone to being numb to being okay with it. My friends and the things that make me laugh help ease that pain.",1

You can mail a small box for like $5, mail her a letter and some of her favorite candy. Any small thing you can think of that just might put a smile on her face would probably help. Even if just a phone call or text.",0
Have you tried admitting yourself anywhere?,0
"omg lol I 100% blame my parents. After taking an AP Psychology course at my school, it kind of shifted my own perspective on my depression. I know I can't claim to be an expert after reading just one textbook, but even an idiot can realize that your behavior and who you are is just totally as a result of your parents. The genetic aspects aren't their fault of course, but they are perfect human specimens, so you can imagine what 17 years of always being wrong has done to my self esteem and thought process. Strangely, being cognizant of that fact doesn't change it much. Of course, I've directly told my parents I blame them for who I am, and as perfect specimens, they told me that I can't keep blaming them for everything. There's truth to that of course, but it's rather incredible that they can find the gall to abdicate themselves of all guilt and responsibility. I'd better just get on my hands and knees and obey their every whim, since they're the ones who work and pay for my existence, regardless of whether or not I can actually do jack shit about that (child labor laws, yo). Lol sorry your post is just so relatable I had to rant.",1
Do you see a therapist ? Maybe a medical treatment with a psychiatrist and regular appointments could help you ? I have been doing it it and it has been helping me,1
"I understand. You regret going to sleep knowing that when you will wake, it will all be the same. Nothing changes, same problems different day. But I have realized, slowly and painfully, that the changes won't happen unless I make an effort to try and change things Currently I keep getting pissed at myself for staying up as late as I do, drinking myself to sleep, and hoping that in the morning, something new will happen instead of what really is going on in my life. The point I'm hoping to make is that we need to make the effort of change if we really want to change how our life's are headed, and we need to hold to that change.",1
"I can only recommend fiction (apologies; not much of a self-help/non-fiction kind of guy) but The Perks of Being a Wallflower (the film; never read the book myself) deals with depression among other things and is very powerful. Much of Sylvia Plath's poetry centres around mental health and depression, if that's of interest, and while it's not something I've read 'The Bell Jar' (which is prose) is also supposed to be very good, according to a former acquaintance of mine. And I recently finished watching an anime called Orange which was mostly very good at dealing with the issue, the one caveat being that characters tend to talk about 'saving' people quite a lot, which can be a little bit galling (lol). Music-wise, Brand New have done a number of songs which either deal with depression (or emotions that can be closely linked to depression) or are pretty evocative in that sense tonally-speaking. Can't think of anything else right off the top of my head but hopefully that's a fair amount of stuff, in the short-term at least",0

I know what you're feeling, well actually mine was worse since I had little friends but if I could back and give myself advice I'd tell myself to man up and do well, work out and socialize because the rest of your life is so dependant on how well you do at your age right now. Please believe in yourself and press forward. Although you have all the time in the world to make changes. Waiting it out will only lead to insanity and depression. It's a problem you don't want to deal with when your older. It's best done in the present.",1

It's something small, but it will make the lives of others better, because you lived. You can build from there and go on to help more people.",1
I feel you. I'm only happy and at ease when I'm drunk. I'm sure I'd drink a lot more if I had more disposable income.,1
"What makes you think you're a shitty human being? I don't know who you are and I don't know your story, so pardon me if I'm coming as rude by saying this (that is not my intention, I'm solely trying to help), but maybe some of those reasons aren't founded. For example I often worry that all the people I love will abandon me, and even though it's not really founded and I know in the back of my head that it probably won't happen, it is still one of my largest fears.",1
"You don't overcome it. You learn to live with it. Its who you are and there's nothing wrong with that. I find thrill seeking helps me. I'm sure it's not the most productive strategy, but it definately gets me to keep waking up. If you ever need to talk, feel free to message me.",1
"The only way I'll exercise is if it's a real task that matters, like jogging to get to the bus stop on time or lifting furniture at work. I can't do the whole exercise for the sake of being healthy thing. I don't care enough about my health for that to work.",1
"Well I will find out because I can't even stay hard anymore, so I'm giving up on it. Going from 7 times a week to 0.",0
I always have herbal OTC sleeping supplements prepared in case that happens. Relaxing teas works too but then you are sleepy and have to go to the toilet. In many cases they work pretty well.,1
"Oh crap dude me too... I keep lying in bed all day and binge-eating junk food (like, an entire bag of hot cheetos and then more) and l always end up feeling even worse after but l can't stop.",1
"What currently feeling. If you want you can talk to me. Rant it out, listening",1
"Why the heck do we hate ourselves?! Man such as crappy lie we have bought from seriously the pit of hell. Nothing else could be so evil as to make us not believe we are worthy and deserving of a good life just as much as everyone else. Sorry to get weird there, it just makes me mad that anyone has to feel this way about themselves. Anyway, I have one scar on my arm from one time that I tried that and there forever. It still makes me sad when I see it. so sorry for what pain you are in. There will be a time in your future where you will not feel so much pain and will hopefully even feel better about yourself &amp; the future you will be so thankful if you permanently scar your face.",1
Sometimes you got to find the right people to help you is all. I think you would be surprised sometimes the people who would be willing to help,0
felt like that before and I honestly know what happened to change it. pretty sure I just got so good at hiding it and acting happy just started to believe myself,1
"Maybe. Maybe its increasing because people are getting convinced by others that they're depressed? But it is a sickness, so that sucks",0
not alone. PM me if you ever need someone to chat.,1
Haven't tried it but know a medical professional that says it really works for many patients. Not covered by insurance though.,1
"You are capable of doing things on your own. If your boyfriend doesn't make you happy, you don't have to be with him. If you are worried about coping, you can take things slowly, step by step. I should follow my own advice here as well: don't be afraid to seek therapy if you can. It will help, even if it only helps a little. As for your job, I'm sorry it didn't work out. But don't let things ruminate in your mind. Worrying about them over and over does nothing to help you. *Depression thrives in rumination*. Try looking into mindfulness meditation. It's not spiritual garbage, it's literally training the neural pathways in your brain to put less weight on particular thoughts, so that you don't get stuck in negative feedback loops. It takes time to change your brain structure, but it can be done. Another thing is to find distractions. Productive is better, but if you keep the less productive ones in check they can be helpful also. Delve into hobbies or learn a new skill. Be social and try new things. That's the best way to cope in my opinion. I need to take my own advice.",1
Same. I drink every night. I look forward to 731 every night so both my kids are in bed and I can pour myself four shots of whiskey,1
"There are judgment free gyms out there such as Planet Fitness. Alternatively, you can buy your own gym equipment (e.g., dumbbells, resistance bands, etc.) / videos (e.g., P90X, Insanity) and work out at home. Exercising has definitely helped me with depression, but for me, it wasn't a magic cure. Exercising did bring many other benefits as well though, including health benefits, physical appearance benefits, confidence benefits, etc. So I highly recommend it",1
That's an accurate description of the past 2 months of my life.,1
"If it was possible, we would live again but we are stuck in this.",0
"I completely understand. The way I felt for my ex was unlike anything else. I never had such a connection with any other person before. It's been about 8 months since we've broke up, I'm still grieving. It's made me fall back into depression. I always thought I could do things myself, but I just realized recently that I can't. I can't always do things alone. I really just crave affection and appreciation.",1
"Exactly the reason I stay away from Instagram, facebook, and snapchat now. Always makes me feel like shit",1
I wish there was something to look forward to.,0
"Therapy: it works if you have a good therapist who helps you understand yourself; why you feel or don't feel certain things, ways you bring certain miseries upon yourself. Also if they are a champion for you. What I mean by that is they empathize with you rather than shoving psycho babble down your throat. They offer real tools for help. Also, you have to put in the work. Therapy doesn't fix anything. Just helps educate you on how to better handle yourself. Meds also work, but sometimes you have to try a few different kinds to find the best fit for you. They don't work overnight either; they can take upwards of 10-14 days in most cases before your brain starts to readjust. For me, I found my original dosage wasn't strong enough after a year or so and had to double up.",1
"Unfortunately im thin anyway and through depression i lost weight because of no appetite.With 24 years of age i look like a 14year old boy. No beard ,just 56 of height. Fuck me.",1
"I can't speak for you, but I don't do anything because I'm depressed. I used to do things but gradually started feeling worse when I'd go out. Now when I try to make plans I can never follow through with them. I feel so bad about myself that I can change my mind about doing things very quickly.",1
Each year just keeps getting worse haha please end me,1
"I would totally cry at my desk, no one even noticed.",1
All it does is make me feel worse because just feel selfish,1
"Very shitty. And you, OP?",0
Sorry to hear that. Hopefully it goes by quick.,1
"I don't have any good advice :( , sorry. This absolutely embodies everything I have ever felt, thanks for at least finding the words.",1
"After hearing every line in the book, I found this single post surprisingly helpful",0
What help do you want,0
"Sometimes it's just the environment you're given, and you have to adapt. I'm very impressed actually that you're able to go to another job interview, it shows some hunger and motivation. And that's the blessing",0
"Youa re comdemned to a life of freedom. Is an old quote i tihnk its from satre, but im not sure. And later there has been others who disagree. You are forced to become alive and aware that much is for sure. Unlike most animals you are a creature born with the abillity gather information and draw conclusion not jsut based on your senses, and that oftens leads to the question. Why am i alive? Not only that, you are forced into not just a world, but a particular part of the word, which then in turn will teach you values and conformaty, and for some people this works out well. If you can find it in yourself to look at the context you have born into and be satisfied with it, enjoy it and love it, if you can find shelter, food, sleep, joy, love and challenge in you enviroment. But for some of us, we don't fin those things, we suddenly find ourself in a enviroment that conflicts with our nature, the context of our existence is not operationable with the essence of our nature. You first statement i cannot, say is wrong, you didn't decide to exist, but netiher did you chose not to. And existing in of itself is not evil or good. But if the context of your life is making your life or nature feel haunted and painful. Then a there are options available. The first thing, no matter how you want to change your context for the better, rquires that you step back and see the context. Where are you from, what values have been impsoed on you, which makes sense to you which doesn't, how has these values been imposed, who has impsoed them. For these purposes your reasoning is a great tool. It easy to finda figure head or a single person to blame, but you really have to map it out, and see udnerstand ana analyse your einvirotment and the people in it, and then find the conflicts with your nature, the pain and sadness. Then you have to figure out a plan. And this is a tremendous task, not just do you have to think thoguhts you ahve not been taught to think, you have to be critical of a system that raised you and shaped you. You have to go against the nature of what normal is and accept yourself. And then you ahve to find out how you want to change the context of your life. alkohol amkes me miserable, and everyone i know drinks Find people you can exist with with out alcohol My father is violent Create an existence were you are independant from him School is terrible translate My class mates bully me daily Find another school thes are simple i know, and jsut examples. Now i know you asked why do i have to do all this hard work and i threw some of the most difficult work and ideas at you. But the things is all what ive jsut said is the reasonalbe arguemtn for you nature, essence and existence and a way to improve it. when you ask why, reason is not a tool that can answer. its like trying to build a ship using lead, sure maybe it can be done, but its deffinately not the best way. Refelection, abstract thought, contemplation, emotion, empathy. those are the tools to arrive at an answer. If reason was used, human life wouldn't really have value. If you were the head of state and only used reason, you would quickly realize, human lives are not what drives you foward, what makes progress and creates a super power. And lives could turn into numbers. Sure educated people anda strong work force is good reasonable arguments to have a population, but only if they are educated or strong. Using reason to determine worth of life can lead to terrible ideas or no answers. You have to work hard right now, because you are worth it depsise allt he pain you are in you are worth it, and you deserve to be your best you. And if you don't liek working 8 hours a day then sleep 8 hours and then have 8 hours for yourself. Then there are options, but because you born into this context you ahve to work hard to get to those oprions. It is hard to change your enviroment. You have to stay alive becuase, you know a humans life has worth and you are one. When you see another in pain you wish he wouldn't ahve to be, when i see your words and want to help you but am incapable i still try. You have worth because of all the thigns you have not done yet, and all the people who have not enjoyed you future self. Stay strong friend Love I wish i speleld better",1
"I feel for you. Even minor setbacks can feel like major hurtles when depressed. found that setting small goals talking to myself positively helps. Maybe just start by trying to eat, shower, and get to sleep on time everyday. If you can do that, then consider the day a success. Having realistic expectations can help you be nicer to yourself. It sucks that going though difficult things and that may not fair, but gotta accept shit. Just work on the little things, my friend! So many things are out of our control.",1
"If you do it, it counts.",0
I feel like shit too everyday. I just wanna fade away.,1
"I think it is objectively pointless, humans seek meaning in things, and life has no definite meaning. For me, it's ironic, on one hand, I want to die ASAP maybe in my sleep, on the other, I want to live as long as possible to witness how far technology can reach, especially for astronomy and VR. I suppose what I'm trying to say is, as many had said before, we have to find our own meanings. We have to find 'joy' somehow, within this pointless struggle until the day we die. It's tough, I know, for I suffer the same.",1

"Man, I fucked up really hard and my parents payed for it. I just fucked up again and they are paying for it again. It is the same mistake as before.

I feel like killing myself would be the greater good.",1
33M here and gay. Never been in a relationship. Probably one of the most painful things to deal with. I feel like I might as well give up too at this point.,1
The reason I use to cut is I couldn't point to a part on my body and say it hurts here. It made me feel better at the time but it wasn't a real solution. You are in pain Broski. If that was me I would think that I had maybe an extra bad day/night and tried to fall back on old habits.,1
haha when I come back home I never even go out into my home town. I can't tell you how severe that problem is - if I met an old friend I'd black out...had a dream it happened...it's awful.

"It means that you have transformed your misery in a fundamental aspect of your identity and anything and everything that happens in your life is gonna be somehow linked to that. It is gonna become impossible to differ between what is truly a hardship from what you are deciding to see as such, because pain has settled within yourself to the point that things would not make any sense if it was not present, so you will inflict it upon yourself to return to the only state of familiarity that you know: being miserable. The term fetishizing is used in a harsh, accusatory, pejorative way, blaming the characters for perpetually watching their lives through the blackest prism, but the truth is they just do not know any better than to do so. Furthermore, fetishes are often believed to be shameful and obscene in nature, because such random, nonsexual items PRODUCE intense satisfaction, whereas people that are accused of fetishizing sadness are just sheltering themselves (if i fuck myself up, no one else will).",0

We all die in the end... there is no reason to rush it :) nothing matters beyond what we want to matter, but if you conclude that life is meaningless and boring and hard then whats the point in that perspective? If it is meaningless then what else is there to be meaningful? what do you base those views off of if nothing else has a point for existence? Of course that assumes you actually think it's pointless or meaningless... or hard, which you do there for, how do you know something you've never experience is easier? Ah my rambling gets me nowhere because no one else cares to see it that way... eh oh well. Anyways, what is troubling you?",0
What are you getting into?,0

"Here is a goal: get out of bed. I'm sure you are familiar with that crushing feeling where you just cant move because your depression is so fucking heavy. Just move a little bit. None is expecting you to be the fastest person in the race, we just want you to keep moving forward with us. A good goal is something achievable. On my broken days, my goals are to get up, take a shower, make a bowl of cereal. I'm a bit luckier than most, I have a wonderful wife and child, and they help me out when it comes to keeping myself moving forward. Just tiny things should be your goal. Eat an apple. Stretch. Take a shower, fuck, take a bath. Dont try to solve world hunger, just do what is possible for you. Message me at any time, we are all in this fight together.",1

I wish there was an easy way to die. Like one pill I could just pop. Unfortunately everything has to be messy,1
"It's a sad reality that everything comes to an end and that we're not given an exact explanation of why we're here or what the meaning of it all is. The way I see it is that we're here to give our life meaning one way or another. Since we don't know the meaning we have to make the meaning. Some people find that through their work, family, helping others, etc. Life is full of endless possibilities of what we can do with it. It's hard getting to the point where we feel like we're happy or accomplished but that in itself is another aspect of life and finding meaning. For some people it could take most of their lives to find the meaning that they were looking for and in my view I'd rather spend my whole life looking for that meaning and helping who I can along the way than to just accept that there's no meaning to it and end it since that's not really an answer. I may never get the answer myself but I can at least enjoy the journey leading to the end and maybe that in and of itself was the meaning all along. You'll meet many varieties of people throughout your life who will give you different perspectives of what meaning is to them and maybe that will help you on your journey and maybe it won't. We have the time we're given and what we do with it is dependent on us. Even after we die and join the rest of the universe in it's infinite there'll still be people around who will say, Hey remember u/OkayScience, I want to do what he did and live my life to its fullest. We can still be remembered for the life we lived even after we're gone and in that way we'll essentially live forever. This is the way I see life and it helps me from time to time. I still have my bad days and sometimes consider if it's all worth it but then I just keep going because I won't know if I just stop here. Plus it helps talking to people about it at times and if you do feel like talking about it more feel free to send me a message. Keep going with the journey and stay strong since you'll find your meaning in time.",1
Are u boy or girl??,0
Yes. Doing anything is good. Specially these things that are just for yourself. It can be hard or even seem silly but if it is something you had to convince yourself to do and then managed to do it. That is good.,0
I'm sorry. I wish I could help. I feel the same way.,1
"Yeah. My parents took me to a psychologist when I was a teenager, and that was one of the questions she asked me. I felt two things. 1. How would I know? I don't know what normal is. I only know what my experience is. How would you? How could you even measure that? It's not like there are distinct and separate thoughts you can count, it's just a flow. 2. What kind of terrible precedent does that set? Since when is thinking bad?",1

And when your in the tunnel for a while you look back and forward but see nothing but darkness, it feels like it is all that is has been and will be. But tunnels always have an end. This train ride of life will get you where you want to go, as long as you get off early.",1
"I guess for like short moments everyone has done it, but most wont remember it since it wasn't really a serious thought, just a quick idea.",0
"Ask them what's wrong, what's troubling you, how do you feel, what did you do today, how did it begin, when did it begin. But don't ask like you're interrogating them. Say it in a nice tone. Don't say it gets better, or life is worth living, etc. It's annoying to the person, always. It's nice how you care for them :)",1
Well fair enough. I'm sorry there isn't anything I can say to help :/,1
That's my dream. Just hitch a ride to amsterdam and try to find some job,1
"Thing will only start looking up when you do. Its ok to feel down and hurt for a bit, but don't let it consume you. I briefly looked through your post history, you're going through a break up, it's understandable. I am also going through a break up and depression came with it. You gave your heart to someone and expected them to so the same. When they didn't you became devastated. The truth is you're a loving caring compassionate kind person and deserves someone who wants you always. It will work out, things will get better but you have to try and make them better.",1

Therapy and meds. I go to support groups every Thursday. I avoid alcohol. I read and write everyday.,1
If you are not happy and you are not ill then you need to do different things.,0
Maybe that is why we all are naturally depressed,0
"The same advice applies to them in one regard. Need to know sadness to really be happy. It sucks that depression is part of my life, but it gives my character a unique value that is missing in others. Still would rather feel good without falling back into the void every time.",1
"Lmao that's my plan honestly. Got sick of it, can't stomach shelling out $700+ a month when I earn $8 an hour just for a shitty apartment I'll never have time to spend in because I'm worried about making the rent for it. It's depressing and monotonous. I'm personally building a van to live out of right now, I plan to leave in the summer. I think of you have any itch to get out there and do something that makes you feel whole you should do it. I've dealt with depression long enough and frankly I'm sick of it, so I'm trying something a little new. Travel, fresh people, fresh scenes, fresh work. It won't be the most luxurious life but it'll probably provide more than the norm of working all day every day.",1
"All the time. On paper, my life is fucking fantastic, but I'm still always sad. And I don't know how to make it better, because everything's already pretty great",1

"When i have good days i think about what was different. Many times my good days are ones i spent someplace else by myself. Like a town the next county over, for example. Recently i went into a city at dusk and just walked around by myself. I was never alone but i wasn't around anyone who knew me. It was good. Didn't end the dep but it was good.",1
like all emotions have been blocked off from me..,1
"What seems to be weighing you down lately? If you need someone to talk to, I'm here. :)",1
"Then makes some, and create your own future. Not the one you think people expect of you",0
"Perhaps that's not such a bad thing for the time being - at least it sounds like you're still doing the necessities of life whether you want to or not and whether there's anything resembling pleasure in it. It seems that's how I've been operating for a few years myself - doing things because I have to not because I want to. At least we're doing them, maybe we'll get our mojo back and want to do something later.",1
"Hey there, feel free to pm me if you need to chat. No judgments from me, just ready to listen, so feel free to say anything you want or need. Please stay strong.",1
"Hey i feel ya, today is my 20th bday, Im drunk in the middle of the day and thinking how to end everything asap",1
"really depressed right now and I feel like it helps me been drunk that past 5/6 days and as soon as I sober up I feel like I do anything . I suppose the hangovers make it worse for a few days but when drunk worth not feeling as bad as I do when not drinking, I stand being sober and dealing with my thoughts. a bad cycle but I like to drink until my life kinda brightens up a little bit that way easier to be hungover",1
for me i think its a little of both,0
"you can get through this i promise. hang in there, just get through the day. tomorrow is a brand new day.",1
Does your school have any counseling or therapy? I think depression amongst grad students is way too common,0
You have one of the best names ever seen.,1
"Lots of cannabis, which I can't even use much anymore since I lost my job",1
"I tried one once. It was a cool experience, but I'm also afraid of the dark, so it was a little anxiety inducing (they had a button to turn the lights on though). I don't know if it's really helpful, but it's still something I'd recommend, even if just for the experience",1
I have many times i have made plans and let them go i want to try agean just to get away from it all i just want to hop on a train and go whare it goes and maby be hapy for once in a long time sorry for bad gramer and bad spelling,1
"I trust my dogs and cats more than humans. Humans are fallible. Animals are just who they are. When it comes to trust in humans, it comes down to expectations. What are your expectations? When you enter into a relationship, it is something you should talk about. If you don't, you will find that everyone has different expectations. And you will never find a relationship in which you can trust.",1
"Yes. And i do like some company. I'm a confused person. Sometimes I like being alone, No one around me, sometimes I want someone with me .",1
"That's wonderful news, you should be proud of that progress.",1
"My gut reaction is that if you were just insisting in wallowing in misery, you wouldn't be wondering about this.",0
I feel the exact same way as you do and I'm tell my self that I'm fine. If ever want to talk about PM. I feel when you talk about your lonliness it helps to get through. I use discord and WhatsApp if that's your thing. Don't be to hard on yourself everyone in the world is loved by someone.,1
"I think porn and affection are different really. You wouldn't love a friend just to fuck them, you love someone emotionally. Do you have a tinge of 'why the fuck did I do that' after watching porn? I used to see a lot of shit. It takes time to quit this drug that controls your actions. I hope you find someone, I haven't, but I just try and remember friends, cute girls, whom I'd never imagine in that situation. Buy a scarf and choke yourself until it hurts if you want to think straight.",1
Having a drink is okay now and then. Most do it even when they aren't depressed just to feel relaxed. If you have problems with it then yes it can be bad for you.,1
Same I'm tired of waking up exhausted even though I get a good amount of sleep. Life is general is bullshit,1
I know the feeling :(,1
"Misery loves company...I just moved to a new state a month ago. Quit my job, left my family. The only friends I have right now are my landlady and realtor. It's really fucking shitty some days. Hang there if you can.",1
"I just sent my support out, it should arrive in a few weeks, $3.95 shipping charges.",1
"being depressed means you're almost as sad as you can get, the fact your thinking about your friend is how you know you cared. Most people don't care enough to do that once they've cried a little.",1
"I can't deal with it, I just push through everyday",1
"By spending time with people, in person. You'll probably fuck up a lot, make lots of social faux pas, feel like your the biggest idiot in the world (I do pretty regularly). However after a while you'll get better at being a 'normie'. Well as normal as people can be. We're all a fucking mess with no idea what we're doing, we just find other people who are a mess that are fun to hang out with.",0
Preferably neither but if not an option then just run. Just die,0
What day is your birthday? I turn 17 on February 6th! Do we have the same birthday?,0
I did several months on citalopram but eventually got moved onto escitalopram. I'm now taking Wellbutrin with the latter. Much improved.,1
I hate it when people say that. It makes you feel so guilty for whining.,1
currently in a relationship. I keep thinking going to breakup with me or cheat on me. My anxiety fucks it all up.,1
"Happy birthday dude, it's actually my birthday as well today!",0
I'm the opposite of this. I just ask Can today be worse than what it already is? And Can it be worse than yesterday? Somehow it always manages to get worse.,1
I don't but I wish I did :/,0
"Yep, I was actually feeling pretty good about myself this morning, but now a total 180 and I think a disgusting freak never going to find love... I hate myself",1
I even put up with bad books. Anything that gets me thinking about something else.,1
"Whoa, easy. Whoever she is, and whatever you did, chances are not as irreparable as you think. Time will heal most wounds. And if it is really irreparable, then you move on. One incident is not indicative of your worth as a human being, nor does one opinion determine whether you are good or bad. It might hurt to move on, like *really* hurt, but alright. normal.",1
"I'm going to buy a few lemon plants and plant them in a cute Groot pot just for this reason. Btw, have you considered getting a pet? I don't like pets (bad childhood experience with wild dogs) so it's not for me, but generally people who like keeping a plant alive would love to have a happy, living pet around them",1
Some people are sensitive. Don't change the good things about yourself just because some people don't understand silence.,0
"start with something smaller, like a hermit crab",0
"When I can't sleep I've taught myself to use it. If I can concentrate I read, if I can't I play video games. Anything that helps me to relax. I tend to find that I need to distract myself from being unable to sleep, otherwise it makes me anxious and that makes the sleeplessness worse.",1
"I think accepting that you are YOU rather than that you are ugly could help. Because you ARE you. You're no one else, and you never will be. You have one body, and no matter how you feel about it, it's all you have. You don't have to like your body at this point, just accept that it is yours. I just try to accept the intrusive thoughts for what they are: intrusive thoughts. They're intruding. They don't belong in my head. I don't have to listen to them. They can be there, but they don't have to mean anything to me. I'm stronger than they are. I know the truth. They're just trying to confuse me. That sort of thing. The more you can view them as a separate entity from yourself, the easier it gets, in my opinion.",0
"Antidepressants, therapy, naps, bubble baths, tea, cat snuggles, books, watching movies curled up on the couch with a pillow and blanket, time spent in nature, a good cry. Hang in there my friend.",1
"You are not alone in any of that and my heart goes out to you and I think its important to seek professional help for these types of feelings, im sorry i couldn't help more and hope you get better",1
"Hey. I know who you are, what doing or even thinking right now, but I do hope that still here for now at least, and reading this comment. really sorry for how feeling right now, and even though been through this for the last 2 years already, I say that I understand how you feel; even though I wish that I could. But please, please know that if you still need to talk, you could message me yeah? This truly is a really shitty world; but in light of all this, there are still people who are genuinely kind, who would really want to help. Being a beacon of light for those who are still suffering and letting the light from others shine onto you; this the purpose of living? The purpose of still staying here?",1
Hugs. You do matter. Depression tricks you into thinking the worst.,1
I bite at my nails and the skin around them. My mom gets really mad whenever she sees me doing it :/,1
I feel the same. I start losing weight and then I get super stoned get munchies and binge eat and gain it all back and then just feel like shit. almost not even worth smoking anymore.,1
The Hilarious World of Depression is good. Opens your eyes to how many others are suffering that you would never expect.,0
"Hey, if you ever want to talk about anything, I'm here for you. Just send me a message. You're not alone.",1
"Can you add a little more information to your post? It is kind of vague, confusing (as far as blaming [depression?] on new medicine), and hard to comment on.",0
you are beautiful. pretty sure i've seen your username before,1
How will you fuck people over?,0
I don't really know if it's the Cymbalta. I haven't experienced that myself when on it. How long have you been on it? Maybe it's still building up?,0
Excuse me while I disappear,0
Yeah i feel a little disoriented but in a good way lol,0
"Not so long ago, when I was at my lowest low mentally, physically and emotionally, I didn't leave my bed for about 48-60 hours, just once or twice to pee. The weird thing is that I should've felt starved af but I really didn't, just heard my stomach growl every now and then.",1
They should definitely get a safe that only they can access. No problem then.,0
I wish I had a reason to accommodate this suffering,1
I feel your inner turmoil and pain. I'm not sure of your age or history but I was married for 14 years (no children) and have lived on my own the last eight. It hasn't been easy. It's not fun. There were times I didn't trust myself alone and I recognized that I needed to take steps to help myself so I sought out therapy and it has been helping tremendously (both the one-on-one therapy and resulting meds). Do you have a therapist? Do you have access to one? If so I highly recommend going. It's one of those things that carries almost no risk - it can only help.,1
"The little things, the small moments of joy, the feeling of fulfillment. Even if you live a life with more sadness than happiness you still had some happiness. Always remember at your saddest that there will eventually be more happiness down the road.",1
Pm me if you want to talk,1
"There's nothing wrong with being a virgin. I'm one, too, and I don't feel bad about myself for it. I'm proud of it, actually. Also, I don't understand sexuality probably because of my autism. Remember, it's not a competition. Once you lose it, you can't get it back. There are a lot of other types of love out there than just physical love. I don't understand why people around my age are upset about being a virgin to begin with. Don't feel so negative about yourself. There are people in this world who love you already such as your family. Take care of yourself.",0
I know how you feel. Everything went to shit for me too.,1
Not as long as you aren't hurting yourself or others,0
"we on the same boat. havent been going to school, probably already failed some of my classes. theyre just a group of fucking morons anyway. broke up with gf. have no friends. the ones I had were fake. shit.",1
Happy birthday from me to you. It's mine also. I hope you enjoy your day regardless of whatever you do.,0
"Yet success also occurs. But when it does, it's almost like magic, with barely any effort at all. Luck, some call it. Makes you wonder.",0
"Every job you mentioned will have significant pressure, which can lead to more depression. Artist - a friend of mine is a indie musician type of artist. Born in a rich family, great social support with what she does, good education. She accepts that being an artist doesn't bring good money because interest and passion matter more. Still has been clinically depressed for years. Still making meager money. Every person I can think I'd back in college that studied fine arts or art history has rich families so they can continue to pursue a masters or phd in areas they like without worries. For those who don't have a privileged background, starving artists are no cliche - that's the norm. And I think people who are already depressed are unlikely to find poverty to be a good escape. Film - very unstable depending what you work on. Networking is extremely important and you must be socially savvy because it's all about power and money, even in independent films. This means competition and getting funding will be incredibly difficult. Therapists - you need good education and superb social skills and emotional control. A depressed person is unlikely to have the latter. All require years of training. Nurses - I don't need to elaborate more. Just google how many perfectly healthy, capable, and motivated nurses who still got burnt out and depressed. It's long work hours, high pressure and physically demanding to boot. What I want to say is this: any profession will have major shortcoming and sacrifices. There's no such thing as profession that are suitable for depressed people. Any job can turn a healthy person depressed - on the contrary, any depressed person can find recovery by engaging in other professions and become successful.",1
A therapist should discourage anything that fuels your depression/illness,0
If I knew it wouldn't break my mum and stuff heart I would be dead already.,1
"Why do you hate yourself OP? We all make mistakes in life. But, we learn from it, grow, and hope to make better decisions moving forward. That's part of life. Is there something that's causing you to feel guilt, or shame? Hope everything turns out okay...",1
"I'd rather be alone than with people who are mean. Learning to enjoy your own company is difficult but once you get there you're set. Love yourself first, the focus on forming relationships with others",1
"I think I can only live if I keep myself happy. If I relax, the nightmares come ... :(",1
Just tell them straight up. I'm sure they will understand.,0
"I know what you mean, I've put off going to the doctors for about a year so far partly because of this... I think it's healthier to contextualise it like this: Is my emotional state effecting my quality of life? Do I constantly put myself down and have low confidence? Comparing yourself to others is a race to the bottom, somebody is always 'worse' off in your eyes because you dont value yourself as much as you do other people, your mind down plays your own successes and overplays others. The hard bit is convincing yourself that is the case, fuck even I'm not convinced and I have some self awareness of why I feel the way I do, it's hard man. Your feelings are real and you dont need to prove otherwise to anybody but yourself.",1
Whats on your list? Maybe while you're doing it you'll find more things to add,0
end it man! Go somewhere. Be on your own. Figure yourself out. nobody so broken that it cannot be fixed.,0
Yeah my life is over already I'm 22 and there's literally nothing I can do to start my life. People keep telling me I am young and have plenty time left for everything. It's just not the case though when you have nothing and never have there is no chance of you ever having anything and having a life.,1
"You stop by examining your negative habits that you have and changing them, and also committing to yourself to not push people away even when you want to. It's your natural response sure, but you really have to struggle to change that pattern. It's going to take resistance, and you have to have motivation to do it.",0
"What about just fuck it. care about the problems no more? what I did and it worked for me over the span of 3 years. No fucks given, to anything, anyone.",1
"I could understand how awkward IBD might make certain social situations, and I'm sorry you're having to deal with it. Middle to high school are the developmental years, and having to deal with abdominal pains/bathroom runs every single day in that time period is frustrating I'm sure. With that said, there is just so much to look forward to. While your issues might fall onto deaf ears for people your age, IBD isn't going to be something that's going to prohibit you from living and leading a normal life. Special arrangements can be made for college/work(especially if you're working in a technical field, you might enjoy a mix of online classes) and you're going to find that people are generally more empathetic as you grow older. Hang in there man. I can't possibly know you and what *else* you're going through just with a single throwaway post, but I'd encourage you to talk with your family if you're feeling serious suicidal thoughts. It sounds like they love you and would try to support you :) Take care",1
Ah r/depression the only sub positive comments are downvoted to shit,0
"How old are you. Im 29 and im also counting every second, this shit just wont end",1
I know how that is. Resting feels like the right thing to do but it never quite works. Have you thought about taking a sleep aid? I take mirtazapine before bed and it makes me sleep better and I feel better the next day. More rested and alert. It is part of my strategy to finally lift my depression.,1
"I can relate. The only place I try is at work, and that takes all my energy. feel like I have energy to do much else.",1
Average is great! At least you don't suck.,1
I did. The nightmares were so bad I had to stop taking it because I couldn't sleep. A few days after stopping I was able to sleep much better. Unfortunately I'm not sure what you can do to avoid stopping the meds.,1
I'm available as well. I'll even give you my phone number,1
"i feel you m8.. been clinically depressed for like 4 years now, it sound long but it feels like been forever. depression be cured. it can be treated. there are so many neurotypicals that try to tell me i will get better, but thats the only way they know how to comfort people i guess.",1
I use to be miserable. I hated my wife. My life. Lots of stuff. But one day I just Decided to be happy. I got up. Told by bitch wife I loved her. Kissed her. Got up and sang in the shower. But i was miserable again in an hour. But then the next day i tried again. And the next afternoon. Again and again. Finally my wife wasnt a bitch anymore. My life wasnt so bad. I realized being miserable can be a choice. Our emotions can be changed by our actions. Wake up and just pretend to be happy. Pretend you like your job. Fail and do it again.,1
Nothing bad has to happen to be depressed. Try shaking things up a bit an do something different or new might make you feel better also be glad nothing bad has happened to you that's a good thing,0
"Currently in the middle of this. Don't want to get out of bed. No desire to see other people. Never remember anything. But I have 2 jobs and I'm a student. I don't have a choice but to be high functioning. It makes me hate my depression (because it's inconvenient), leaving me even more depressed.",1
The only time I leave my house is to go to work or go shopping. I guess that is a shut in.,0
Every victory is well deserved :),0
"Yes, worrying about this is normal EVERYONE does it, but you must not let it take over your life. Speaking to your girlfriend/wife is the most important thing, making sure they are happy and making sure you are happy is what is important.",0
"more often than not, i end up giving a half truth. or, i guess more accurately, a partial truth. when i'm with friends 9/10 they make me feel good and forget about my shit show of a brain. so i answer with good! or feelin' great now! because at the time, thats how i feel. but mostly i leave out how i felt before seeing or talking to them. that may be wrong or decietful, but i just don't like to burden my friends with this. especially those who can't handle my neuroatypicality.",1
Truer words have never been written,1
And what's the reward of finishing school? Working full time.,0
I'm always focused on myself. Even when people are talking to me- I'm too focused on how they are actually perceiving me than listening to then,1
"And this is why I am sleeping like 12 hours a day now. In my dreams, everything is great. Then I wake up and it is like F*ck me, not",1
Yes I feel guilty all the time. I want to be and do these things that seem simple to others yet I struggle to wake up everyday just to take care of them. I have a hard time feeling a connection to one of my kids and I work really hard to make sure that's not felt by her,1
Every single day I wish that I could go back 4 years ago. Back to before my mental health went to the shitter. Do things so differently.,1
"Yes, tell them to fuck the right",0
"It's the same for me...I can't believe how little I've experienced. There's a part of me that wants to really live rather than just 'existing' but I don't know if I'll ever be able to let myself. I guess if you can take that step and put yourself out there, make each day mean something even if it's only small things etc, you should. But I know it's a lot easier said than done. I don't really have any advice for you, but just wanted to let you know that you're not alone. Maybe volunteering somewhere could help you if that's something that's possible for you...doing something meaningful and giving yourself purpose and all that.",1
"I may just be a random stranger in the internet but you are definitely not a bother. And, how are your lungs?",1
You can start over. Start now.,0
you came to the wrong place,0
"Keep the idea of suicide as the last resort in your mind. This is actually quite comforting for me, as I know always an option. Once that is accepted, focus on taking it one step at a time, trying to appreciate each small thing in life. One day, hour, and moment at a time. Stay busy, see friends, remain clean and tidy, and be as kind as you can to yourself.",1
I just cried today because I didn't felt like killing myself in the morning... but after that I realized how stupid crying for that it is that I immediately thought of suicide... yay,1
That's quite a common symptoms among the depressed actually. I can relate to very well.,1
How do you know that?,0
I understand completely. If it weren't for my daughter I'd be gone. Right now even holding out for her is very hard. Truthfully if I had a firearm I don't know what I'd do.,1
"I feel you, honestly beginning to wonder if college is really worth it.",1
"Not in college, maybe never will be, but at this point I'm not even bothered about being alone, in fact I relish it.",1
"That someone will come into your life when you least expect it. I want to kill your hopes by saying that they cure your depression, because they very well could, but they also may not. I will say, that having someone you love and someone who loves you does help. But remember that you have to put so much effort into looking for someone because the right person will show up without you having to try so hard. beat yourself up if you have anyone yet, it takes time of course. Focus on yourself and doing things that you enjoy, things that help pull you away from depressive thoughts. get through this",0
Where are you in the world?,0
A very similar thing happened to me but only the first half. We talked from 6 till 10:30 till the closed. I thought there was a connection but I never ever ever heard from her ever again.,1
I think most anti-depressants give you nightmares. Both my mom and I take them and we both have horrible nightmares. You get used to it.,1
"Im not you so Im not going to say that I understand. But Ive been in that sort of situation, similar at least. From the point of view of those who are your friends or family, its really hard to see someone you love in that situation, sometimes they don't even know what to do so they leave you because they feel they are not helping because they dont know how. All i can say is that you will met people that will stay with you and understand at some point but it takes effort and time, it took me some time. I hope i helped... Sorry if i didn't but its like i said before I don't want to talk nonsense if i dont know your point of view",1
Don't get way too attached to the external manifestations of your emotions. Can't cry? So what? If you feel sad it doesn't really matter if you have some salty water in your eyes or not.,0
"This has sorta happened to me too. I feel like I'm more cynical and aware, but I feel distant and like the issues don't really matter in the end.",1
Try to focus on the little things in life that you find joy in. Something I've always struggled with it focusing too much on the big picture and when you do that it often just becomes too much to handle and you get yourself all freaked out.,1

Hey :) what don't you like about school?,0
Yeah. I'm perpetually tired. It's wonderful /s I hate it especially because I'm tired no matter how much I sleep.,1
How did you manage that?,0
Same here. How do I cope with it? Hmm I think I just resigned in getting a girlfriend or better finding 'true love'. I'm just getting sick when I see couples and wish to exit the world. I read somewhere that you should love yourself first and then love follows along or something like that. It's very hard to me because I feel like a piece of shid. Well atleast I have series and animes to kill my time.,1
"I'm sorry to hear about your dog. Losing a pet is a tough thing to go through. Is it possible to have her euthanized? To save her some pain and you some emotional suffering? Honestly, I think that would be best, if it's at all possible. I had to watch my dog die years ago. It still haunts me because of how much she suffered and how little I was able to do to help. *-hugs-*",1
"I'm sorry. This is true for me as well. And they regularly remind me. I think we can get through it though. Actually, that's a lie. I hope you can get through it. I'm not going to be able too.....",1
i can relate. where are you from?,1
"Cognitive dissonance: when thoughts and actions diverge, you change your thoughts to match your actions. In this case, the action is initial actions you take or take because of your depression. We want to justify why we did that, so we come up with reasons to explain the behavior in terms that are wrong but palatable.",0
"If you wrote this, I think that means you still think someone on here would care. And you'd be right.",0
Sorry. That sucks. But you can move on from this. Don't let them hold u back. You can and will do it.,1
most of the time they might do it just to boost their ego or somethingn if you were to spill and explain to them whats wrong they wouldnt do anything i highly doubt they would honestly care its like always saying hello to a person you have known for many years like we just say it to say it we know. If they dont understand it they wont know how to help,0

"People are generally selfish and inconsiderate. Different people have different ideas of what friendship is, or should be. You are not crazy, they just don't understand your emotional needs.",1
hard to see our impact on society from a single moment in our lives. We downplay our contributions or sometimes we never even know that a small act of kindness affected someone. Or just being around helped them get the the day. Your not worthless or a mistake. Your life matters a lot.,1
"You don't. All my life I've scorned going to college because it held no value for me. I plan to become a traveling hermit and live in the wild with a tent or tarp. I consider myself a successful human being because I've cultivated my mind. I've figured things out. I've matured enough to manage my own personality (as in, not being one of those if you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best people). Stick with what makes logical sense (you don't need to be successful in the graduating and having a high-paying job sense), not what people will validate, because they won't collectively validate everything that makes sense (namely, the idea in parentheses above: the same idea that you don't need to be successful; most people aren't going to validate that, so fuck them). If it makes logical sense that you don't need to be successful in their bullshit sense, go with that, regardless of whether people will back it up. Logic over worthless people's worthless validation.",1
I feel you're pain OP. When it comes to texting holding a conversation is like rocket science.,1

"Ok, how deeply did you cut yourself and with what? If it is bleeding a lot, clean it up, run it under water, don't let the blood dry and go nasty. Pat it dry. Bandage it up, if you can. Also if you have some antiseptic cream, use some of that on it. Don't drink any more for now, maybe try and get some sleep or have a nice bath or shower or watch tv or something so you can calm down. Please see a professional- a doctor or a therapist or something. Self harm is very serious. I have been doing it for many years, and it is a difficult addiction to break out of. If you feel the urge to cut again, take a deep breath, count to 10. Write your feelings down or draw them out, even if you don't think you're a great artist or whatever. It will help to get the emotions out. Do you have a good friend you can talk to about it? Or a pet or even a stuffed toy? Talking helps. I'm sorry you're feeling this way. Please let me know if you want to talk. You are a strong person &lt;3",1
Happy new year!:) I spent my new years eve alone as expected,1
"It depends what kind of things you usually enjoy doing, watching a of something you can really grip to is a option that can help. I hope you can start to feel better soon, even though sometimes it feels like you have no one, there are people out there who if they knew you were hurting would support you. why is great (:",1
"I feel you. If you ever want to talk, I'm here",1
"I started by deactivating Facebook. All of it. Give the important people your number, and then just shut Facebook, messenger and insta down. Leave snap or texts for emergencies and basic social upkeep to let people know you're alive. You can even get extensions for your computer browser to block them. Do this for the sites you obsess over. Find a replacement hobby, make a list of things you need to do. Set a time for when you can check social media again so it isn't a never thing to your brain, just a 'you only have this many days left!' Sort of thing.",1
"I usually do a random marathon run of something, whether it's games, work, hobby study or movies, cleaning etc (there is a whole lot more). Random work or hobby study are not my go-to but it depends on the situation and mood I'm in. Once you get into it's cathartic, but it's getting the ball rolling that is insanely difficult. I usually give up when I fall to start and sleep with anger but it goes away when I wake up.",1
"Hi Talk2muchaa, Lik onus111 suggested, 'feeling like doing something' just does not happen. If you're deeply unhappy with a lack of activity in your life, you just need to force yourself to do it - That's the sad reality of it. HOWEVER, that doesn't mean that there aren't ways to make FORCING yourself 'easier' on your mind and less stressful. If you want to build a house consisting of a 1000 bricks, take 30 seconds a day to lay 3 bricks and in one year, you will have a house. You can't punish yourself for not building Rome in a day. You will go on Twitch and see streamers who are making millions... YouTubers who are making millions. I mean fuck, PewDiePie has 56 million subscribers. But that shit didn't happen in just one day. You need to break shit up into increments. Perhaps others don't have to do this. But it's the only way I've found to get anything done. If you want to learn a language, go on Duolingo. Set a '10 points per day' challenge. Yes, it's jack-shit in terms of work. It takes literally 2 minutes a day, BUT- it's something. Try and ignore your brain saying Increase the goal to 50 a day, we're getting fuck-all done because this will break your discipline and you'll go back to 0 a day. Consistently doing 10 a day for 11 days, is better than doing 50 a day for 2 days, burning out and stopping altogether. The key to beating depression-induced laziness is TINY, incremental steps. For example, I'm learning Calculus on Khan Academy. One. Lesson. A Day. That's right- the average Khan video is around 10 minutes. I do one video a day. I am slowly, but consistently learning. Each day I go over the notes from the previous day. The problem isn't volume- it's consistency.",0
"Not Hollywood per se, but Ned Vizzini suicide hit me hard. now live for real, Craig. Live. Live. Live. I feel many similarities between him and me (same age, etc). A successful author but this disease is just too much sometimes.",1
I can't get anything done if my bed isn't made. It's the first thing I do every morning.,1
I love going to forest Parks and looking at all the plants and animals. It helps to a certain extent.,1
you sit on the sidelines and watch everyone else pass you by.,1
"Shoot yourself in the face with kindness. Go and treat you some motherfucking chocolate and some fucking videogames and calm the holy fucking fuck down. This was a lot of fucking swearing but even fucking think about killing your damn self. You will leave some fucking people who will for fucking fuck sake miss you. So - as as friendly reminder - please kill you! *You* *matter* ! Never ever think about this again or even post this shit. I want you to stay alive and fucking nail it! You can do it, buddy!",1
"Here is a good tip: When you get vegetables and fruit, make a small plan to when you will eat them. That way you won't feel overwhelmed and take the easy route. I planned on eating an apple a day and physically assaulting every person with a labcoat that I see on the streets and so far my plan has worked wonderfully! I slapped so many doctors!",1
"the thing, though, your death be feasible. Your mom and sibling would spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was something they did or said that pushed you over the edge, or thinking about what they could have done differently to be there for you. One of both of them would likely spiral into a depression of their own. I used to think that no one would miss me much if I killed myself, but always remember the sound of my brothers voice when he found me with blood pouring from my arm. That something that you can just get over. Even leaving notes really help the pain for your family. Also consider the suffering of the people who found you. It could be an RA or a dorm mate. They would be traumatized for life, with severe PTSD from seeing a dead, decomposing body. That point would be too late for you to do anything, so we try not to let it go that far. get me wrong, I know where coming from, and not trying to make you feel bad for would be wrong. And clear from the fact that even thinking about these things that you have some reservations, so build on that. Take every little good thing that happens to you and imagine never feeling that way again, and imagine robbing the people you love of those feelings as well. Forgive me for being brash, but there is absolutely nothing delicate or glorious about suicide. The people who experience it secondhand go through ten times the suffering of the people who commit it. Please, for the sake of a stranger on the internet who cares about you, think again. There is hope out there, even if everything seems hopeless right now.",1
People know how to handle it. blame them.,0
Everyone suggests to exercise but its easier said than done when one feels this lethargic and hopeless. One thing i can say that works for me when im feeling this way are youtube meditations called solfeggio frequencies it subliminally lifts your mood and vibrations upon listening. Very cool amd its my go-to right now.,1
"Me as well. Most of the time when its asked they just expect a good or a fine but if you are genuine they just seem uncomfortable... I would ask how you are doing, but it was provoked by this post lol. If you still feel the need to talk, I'm here :P",1
"Minor problems can become major very quickly. The earlier you start addressing your issues, the better your chance of recovery.",0
People just tell you go to bed earlier. They can't fathom how much effort it takes to drag through every dull day.,1
That's the million dollar question. But I'm only fighting my problems because I'm scared that if I die I would hurt people,1
"Well, we're all here because we've been in the same place one time or another. I, myself, find it hard to believe that it gets better. But, there's always this tiny ray of hope that says just, JUST, hold on for a little longer. And since I've got nothing better to do, I obey.",1
I feel the same way. unnerving to live in a world with so many talented people who do meaningful work and are achieving so much whereas I can do nothing but watch,1
Care to extrapolate on some positive examples of your brain rewiring? The only experience I have with this is my weed addiction since I was 16 and now I'm 20 :/. Only smoked once this last week tho so things are looking up,0

"Iam hoping for the same thing. I make stupid decisions when I drink. It was a great coping mechanism for my thoughts. Except, it actually wasn't. I have relapsed several times. If you are like me and make questionable decisions when drunk then at least that is how your life gets better. It is just getting to sobriety takes effort.",1
Wish and hope work sorry sorry just brutal done everything you have to try again. Fail forward they say. Yes it sucks I know.....,0
"don't. This is just an advice, my way of looking at things. I believe that you are not surrounding yourself with the right people, but it's true that most of the times we don't really get to choose who we meet. Having a caring heart is nothing to be ashamed of, and it would be a pity if your kindness gets lost in the midst of the crowd just because you want to fit in. There are a lot of people like you, that I can assure you, so as long as you are at peace with your thoughts and with who you are I'd suggest you should keep on being yourself. Take care (:",0

I asked my therapist last week the same question and she promised that it would pass and get better. So to hoping she was telling the truth for both our sakes,1
How dare you steal my prized possession?!,1
I get this problem to. Eventually I fall asleep but it's like I have to embarrass myself to sleep every night.,1
"We all are, in ways. And it's okay.",1
I think it's necessary to have a sense of humour. Usually it's a morbid humour :) my ability to joke actually increased a lot after I started suffering from depression.,1
Frequently. Because life isn't enough.,1
"Same. I get a weird feeling in my chest and it gets hard to focus. Which is weird because I loved it for 2 years before it started happening, I was known as a stoner and I loved being one. Now I try and avoid it. It gave me some amazing memories I'd love to relive but I just can't smoke without having the weird feeling happen, literally the smallest amount can make me feel weird.",1

"There is also another factor that you sometimes dont notice, how you are perceived by others by body language. Im a really shy introverted person, but i had multiple people telling me that i came over as real angry threatening dude with a frown on my face and i never noticed this in my entire life. So, you need to be confident in yourself, showing through body language that you are a good guy to hang out with, i simply cant say how to do it, but thats one way to explain this.",1
"Hey man, I'm there with ya. My ex broke up with me in the fall and I'm still hurting over it. I know it sucks really hard, and I can't say it gets easier, but I know there a LOT of other people feeling the same thing, including me. Hang in there man, it's the most you can do.",1
Since kindergarten at the least. funny because I am a rather gentle person.,1

"You've probably heard this before- that you should try improving your quality of life and see how that works. But I know how it can feel like nothing will ever change. So I propose that in order for you to prove things can't get better, give your life the absolute best shot you can give instead of giving up on it now. This way, you can *prove* to yourself and others that you're beyond saving, and the bridge will become a more reasonable option. It's a fucked up way of motivation, yes, but it motivates me",1
The fact that I'll die xD,0
"Just because you don't or can't have access to that level of mental health care does not mean your own mental illness is any less valid. I have always had a team, a prescribing doctor, therapist, and GP. Sometimes specifically a team that works together, sometimes just doctor's that kind of share notes but don't ever meet up. I am very lucky. Very few people get this level of treatment. Any number of genuine suicidal thoughts is too many. Everyone gets depressed, but when you stay there long enough to consider life actually painful to live you have depression. It can be really hard not to play mental illness Olympics. But someone else struggling more does not take away from your own struggle. Your feelings, your illness, are real. They're valid. They have NOTHING to do with anyone else's struggles. Just as theirs has nothing to do with you. Please please please remember that.",1
Yep same here. Tried a whole bunch of different ones over time.,1
Feel free to Pm me Ive been through almost the same thing and overcame it,1

"Talk to someone online, it's sometimes much easier to get friendly with on the net, there are a lot of lonely people there. When I'm feeling down and there is literally no-one there to talk to it helps me to engage in come conversation in open hobbyists communities. Even having fun chat about anything at all (not a support/getting it out of your chests talk) can make all the difference when you don't have anyone else to talk with. The additional benefit is possibility to get motivated to do something new and interesting. It might not be a substitute for talking with a real friend (online or not) about your feelings but if you are so lonely it hurts it's still something.",1

"Pristiq improved my anhedonia a ton, but sent my anxiety through the roof. It's also anticholinergic, meaning I got side effects like dry mouth and weight gain. So if all you have is depression, it could be a good treatment, but you have to watch out for side effects.",1
edited because it wasn't the most uplifiting :D. The point i was kinda getting at was looking at things in the big picture usually helps me,1
"It really doesn't. And I feel that the older I become, the less likely that things will actually get better. When I was younger and receiving medical help, there was still the general feeling that I'd eventually grow up and things would be sorted out. Having recently summing up the determination to see a shrink again, I get the feeling that nothing much can be done. I even wonder if I actually have depression. If my life is full of shit, am I really supposed to feel anything but misery?",1
I totally agree. That's why I visit this sub a lot. It's nice to know you aren't alone.,1
52 and never used street drugs but Id be first in line to try mushrooms if there was a trial or if they become legal. I think they should be handled with care tjo.,0
"Life is a series of choices. Many of the people you involve yourself with are not your first choice either but life.

"You did the right thing. I respect that you got help to save yourself. Takes a lot of balls. You can't choose family. I've got only my mom since 11. I don't have an uncle or aunt who hang out with me. You can choose your friends and to me friends are more important. They kinda replaced my family. And it's horribly wrong when people ask you those questions I'm so mad right now fuck man That guy has 0 empathy. I know you mad af but after you calm down try to look forward and hold onto yourself. You don't need them to save you. They should be supporting you, if not then not. Don't give a shit about them. It's a beautiful world but some people have 0 empathy. I may sound cringe but empathy is something I learned with 3 or 4. I don't know what is going wrong with some people",1
"I know it isn't always possible, but you could try and hang out with other kind of people. I was in a group where I felt really bad because all of them were really judgemental and not close at all.

"I'm right with you, for years. I bought a VR headset because I needed to use vacation from work. I only put it on for 10 min in 7 days off. I just slept and watched the odd video. I wish I had the energy to feel what I used to from games. It was my only real escape.",1

"I'm going to sound mean, but I get so tired of hearing this. If you like someone, say something. Don't just like them for years and years, then get upset or feel bad when they get with someone or someone asks them out. I know it's scary and rejection hurts and a million other things, but if you don't say anything, how in the world will someone know your feelings for them? Plus, if she was really your friend, if you asked her out or something, and she stopped talking to you or humiliated you for that, then she wasn't a good friend, anyway, and you'd be better off without her.

"That is what I thought myself at one point in my life but I was wrong. I took a trip with some friends to Malaysia and Thailand there was high and low points in the trip. The experience I felt was pure happiness and no joking the last time I felt this was when I was a child happy and alive. I noticed what is good and bad in my life, and realized the blessing that I did not notice. It gave me positive momentum even after the trip. Now I am trying to finish my studies and now started seriously training in thai boxing. Recently my psychologist told me that my depression is gone (I can feel the difference) and my anxiety and stress remains high. I made big progress and I am going to make more progress. Basically from my experiences go out and explore. First reflect on your strengths/potential, your interests and the world, then start thinking the necessary steps to live it, even the smallest thing. I sincerely wish you the best. And explain your current situation?",1
"They tell you to get help because they don't know what else to do. If they tell you to go on with your suicide, and you do, they don't want that guilt in their life. But if they tell you to get help and it actually works, they can feel good about having helped someone. Helping a depressed person is kind of tricky if you don't really know what depression is like. I usually just let them know that they're not alone and I know what it's like.",0

"I ran a business for 7 years, *you cannot believe the stress it is*. You absolutely must have all your ducks in a row before you run a business. Your ego gets caught up in it, so when it is having rough times you feel like crap, and when it's doing well you need to use that to prepare for when it inevitably isn't. It can be done, but it's expensive in terms of money, your sanity, health and any relationships that might otherwise happen (however unlikely). I wish I never tried myself.",0
"I wish the same. A simple, pain-free way out.",1
I know that when everything seems futile to me it's time to make some serious changes in my life. make changes and don't settle with an unfulfilling life.

You've got to confront them head on. Force a change, create a mission for yourself. The worst thing you can do is nothing, and succumb to the negative feelings that come with the crisis. Attack it with whatever you have.",1

Do you have any close friends you can trust? If so tell them how you feel and if they're your friend they will you help you through this. Also don't think you're not strong enough to cut yourself.

I've been asked this since I was a kid. I've always given pretty much the same response whats there to smile about? Surprised I didn't get put in therapy as a kid for saying that shit lol. What I meant by it tho was why would I be smiling at this very moment nothing good just happened,1
I do that too. Sleep to waste time. To dream a better enjoyable life. I had a dream I was playing video games with an old high school friend last night. Most cheerful dream Ive had in a long time. Couldnt get back to sleep though....,1

"Wow. It must have meant so much to give yourself to a relationship where that loss hurts this bad. Holy crap, that's quite the level of commitment! Well, that is something to hang your hat on. You have that in you, right? You did it once before. Yea shit hurts right now but you have it in you!!.I cant imagine how happy you will be when you find the next one...maybe one that fits the possibility of a promising relationship? Well, I think you have a good base here. :)",1
I know the feeling. It hurts to think of our missed opportunities and how we failed to express ourselves.. It hurts like hell to have to go through this over and over without changing.,1
"Sometimes. Though I hate to admit it, but a lot of the time it ends up being me imagining myself as the 'depressed me' with different hair and a more callous personality and the 'good me' is already gone. I don't know what that represents about my own mental state, but oh well",1
"It happens dude, all been there. I say going to get better any soon, but it will get better. Your best bet is to take a step back take a deep breath and just try to function without thinking or talking to that person. help the feelings die down, atleast in my experience. currently going through a heart break myself so I can feel your pain but she keeps constantly texting me when trying to stay distant and making me cave and chat with her",1
Beauty is so subjective. There are people out there who will be blown away by you. But I can relate to how hard it is not to live up to your own taste. Take it from someone who has learnt she would rather be valued for her mind than her face/body. People attracted to you for your looks can also be a curse.,1
I get that. You have so much time so you just start thinking and thinking is very dangerous for people like us. If u want here for u,1
"Yes. All the time. I find myself just moving along, following whatever life throws at me. I constantly have this feeling of dread overwhelm me when I notice my brain and distancing myself from the I know what to think. This life sucks. I just never wanted to exist.",1
Trust your intuition. 99% of my friends treated me like garbage and when I got away from them and built my self-confidence up I did things I never thought I would manage.,1
"Stay positive friend! Keep your momentum going! I've had two mantras that I've carried with me since I first muddled through depression as a child. The first is Momentum. I start my day by making my bed, and it gives me a little feeling of accomplishment, and I make it to the next thing, and I try to carry this energy throughout the day, and into the next day. The second is Resolve, and it comes out on the days where I just completely dropped my momentum. These days are much harder, and I have to remember that its worth continuing on, that there's always a little beauty in every moment, even if it's sad beauty, and that I am able to help in the world. Today was a Resolve day for me, but I'm really hoping to get back into a Momentum day tomorrow! Keep a hold of the reasons you found the light, and the way that light made you feel.",1
"Yeah I have a crush on a girl who lives in my same city, she's just perfect, I'd like to talk to her often and to smile when she is near me but I'm just thinking if she would miss me if I die, I was also used to write her but then I stopped thinking that I was annoying her, now I hardly think she is just laughing about me with her friends but I can't get angry with her for that, she's too beautiful.",1
"Most of us on this have been/are there. I know i have. I tend to dwell on the past far too often and besides it's obvious drawbacks it does have one advantage. Remembering the time i did want to die and how I thought there was no other way out. But I decided to live and I haven't actually wanted to die since. Sure things suck, most of the time for longer than we'd like but there are alot of things that make life on this planet right now worth living. I personally am not religious. I think once your dead it's lights out and I very much enjoy consciousness. I only felt what it was like living without it once or twice and those were not pleasant experiences. I'm still technically Depressed, I have been most of my life and likely will be until it's over or I find what it is i need to do with myself to get there. What helped me go from uber frustrated to content is to continue to evolve. I cut off everyone i knew and reevaluated what I want in life... Apparently it's living in a van and not staying anywhere long enough to feel stagnant. I'm not at all a people person and i have a family full of happy go lucky dimwits who talk nonsense and gossip repeating the same routine like that i what life is. That's not what i want. To be happy you need to forget about everyone and their bullshit, and be who you are where you are. Experience what life is, don't waste it and don't throw it away before you've lived it fully. I'm stuck right now, been hibernating as my little brothers personal housekeeper because my anxiety drives me to near agoraphobia. But once i get out of here I'll take all the lessons I've learned on /r/vandwellers and start my life as i know it should be and hopefully that brings me piece of mind for once. That's what works for me, but if your not an antisocial INTP then you might not want to live in a van lol. But I'm sure there is some way you see life should be... There's an entire world out there, look at the room around you and remember that's less than a microbe in the grand scheme of things. Do what what want do what drives you, not what you think is expected of you. It's your life, you are the one setting the standards and accepting them. Fuck everyone else.",1
Don't give up! You are valuable. You are strong. Take care of your physical and mental health. Practice self-love. Hope things get better for you.,1
when i'm not feeling depressed I'm anxiously waiting for it to hit me again. I'm unhappy no matter what,1
Hey do you like purple velvet cake??,0
"Staple your organ donor paperwork and DNR paperwork to your shirt, sit at front door to emergency room, shoot self in brain.",0
We all make mistakes. We all let people down occasionally. No one expects us to be perfect. We do however have to learn from our mistakes. Hopefully you can find how to better yourself from whatever mistake you made.,1
"I think a lot of people have this problem, especially when they are depressed. I know that when I'm especially hating on myself, I don't like looking at the mirror. I think we can be way too harsh with ourselves. It's hard for mew to look at myself when I'm super caught up with how I'm supposed to be at my age and everything. You're not alone in this feeling. We need to be kinder and more forgiving of ourselves.",1
Yep. Couldnt have said it better myself.,1
Exactly the same. Sometimes its like a way for washing away the thoughts and the hatred towards yourself.,1
I feel the same. I'm sorry.,1
"Our lives aren't predetermined. You have find out what you love doing &amp; what makes you happy. It isn't easy, but it's always worth it.",0
"For me, it's beer, pills and sex. It's normally short term for me, but I've found myself in a years long rut right now.",1
Have you looked into getting help?,0
"Learn the skills you need to to start getting small gigs. Build more skills. Take gradually bigger gigs. Once a steady, sustainable thing going, quit the day job. Loads of free or cheap resources around for learning the skills. Take some college courses if you want, but I say strictly necessary.",0
"I'll give you the /relationships answer: Hit the lawyer, delete the gym. Or like, the other way around. I know, not married, but it still cheers me up to say that :) Some people are shit. But mostly, people are clueless. People are at different places, different stages in their life. Find any average girl in her late twenties or older, and they'll likely be able to tell you some things they did to dudes they weren't proud of after the fact, but at the time, seemed like the most sane and logical thing, something they needed to do. Guys do the same, just in a different manner. On both sides, it hurts like hell, and is something everyone goes through. Focus on yourself. Not the Tony Robbins rah-rah go you! I mean depression hits, end of relationships suck, they mess with your head and your body. Gym is good because it helps both your self confidence and makes both your body and your head feel better. Best of luck :)",0
"Me too, and I don't even believe in a god. Just do it on the chance I'm wrong",1
I'm just waiting until I turn 21 so I can buy my own alcohol and spend the next year killing my liver. I think 22 will be my last year but sometimes I don't even think I can make it there.,1
"Same here, my birthday is today. Not doing anything special, same shit different day. Also been on meds for nearly a month. Have you noticed any differences from the meds? I haven't noticed any difference, aside from feeling like shit when I wake up lately.",1
Every day my friend...every day,1
"Sorry. I feel the same way. There's absolutely nothing in this life I want. It is kind of driving me crazy though because I don't know what to literally, actually do.",1
"My future, I don't know what I'm going to do and how shitty my life will be.",0
"I'll hit you with the two most powerful stats I learned: Less than 25% of the people who attempt to kill themselves and live, ever try again. Ever. Only 7% of people who have attempted end up dying by suicide. So, chances are what happens is a lot of regret for the pain the action can cause others, but also the realization of how many people do care and would help and support if called upon.",1
"I'm proud of you! Even though I don't know you I truly am. Care for everything that's worth caring, you'll find it's more than it seems.",1
"Made a throwaway a few weeks ago to post something similar to this. But yes, absolutely. The past two years my depression has gotten worse, and so has my credit card debt. I feel like ive dug myself a hole that I can't get out of because of it. Most of what I bought was food too, so I cant even return any of it haha.",1
"Mate, get yourself down to hospital and have an ECG. Make enquiries about this. I had the same thing and wrote it off as anxiety, and it got worse. In my case it wasn't just anxiety. Take the condition of your heart seriously, if you're worried get it checked.",1
I feel that. Coming from a 5' 5 male,0
Does anyone know about that demon?,0
just tired. like a zone-out feeling but 24/7. foggy.,1
"I hated school partly for this reason. Everyone always came back chatty and excited about what they'd done over the holidays. I had no one to tell what I'd been up to for the last few months. It was mostly just doing mundane stuff with my parents, but I still wanted to join in the conversation.",1
Yup that's me as well. The weight you described plus this suffocating feeling/atmosphere. I hope it will disappear once I find the right medication.,1
What makes you feel like this?,0
Give up then. Why keep on smacking your head against a brick wall. That is a lesson I have learned the hard way.,1
"Maybe she just didn't know how to react to it... or just in shock. i think you should see a therapist because it seems that you're a danger to yourself or you could talk to a close friend about your suicidal thoughts. There's more to life than people's validation about you, trust me. It really gets better overtime. Bad thoughts will come and it will pass, you need to find support of others to overcome it.",1
"Acceptance. I've been dealing with it for quite a while now. It's really easier said than done, but after realizing you cannot change objective reality, it gets easier. I find comfort in the fact we truly know nothing. Meaning, perhaps there is more to our observable reality than we can sense. I doubt this however. At least we have been dead before, and it's not something entirely too new.",1
There are many sources of therapy for various situations. It all depends on what these thoughts are and how often you get them.,0
"i know this feeling it sucks so hard, you should try meditating like breath 5 seconds in and 5 seconds out for a long time and you will feel a bit better",1
"i feel the same but also the opposite. sometimes i hate being alone, but many times i wish i was alone when i'm with people i don't like. I'm not sure which is worse. Do you have any good friends?",1
"I can totally relate. It feels like you are living on Facebook and you are expected to only show the good things to appease everyone. Personally I have stopped doing that now and the people who are actually really my friends and who truly care, have stuck around, the rest - I actually don't care about now. I have the right to be sad, I have the right to not be okay and to have a down time.",1
"What do you enjoy doing in your free time. Sitting around being depressed doesn't make for good story-telling. At least it didnt for me. Also, please don't apologize. We absolutely want to hear how you're feeling on this sub and it's beneficial to see and hear other people's perspectives going through this hell.",1
"There will very likely be a reason to your depression as depression doesn't really start from nothing, sweetheart",0
Why are you thinking about it? What's so wrong in your life that you feel the need to take such drastic measure?,0
"cut out fake friends, don't worry about family problems and focus on urself.",0
"I wonder if there is actually a part of you that hopes that ppl do care, do worry about you, but your scared of hurting others, cos thats how i feel",1
"Hey, is there something that's overwhelming you, or something that you are avoiding? What is going on? Why are you in bed? Sometimes when you share it can help to lighten the burden.",0
Well you wouldn't really be able to enjoy it while dead.,0
"It may not seem like it now, but whatever you're feeling is just a step forward. Without now, next can't happen. The Moment you finally become happy is the same moment you realize all the pain was worth it. Everything you're experiencing is a unique experience that you and only you will ever experience. Why not make your unique experience a happy one? If you need help being happy or finding it, go explore and see what you like. Whether it be asking people online, or going and experiencing something for yourself when you look back, you'll be happy you did it, and happiness is all that matters.",0
So you sick af now or your liver is fucked or something?,0
Every time I dare think I am moving up in any way I get beat down. In any field of life that I try to improve. Its just incredible.,1
I hear you brother/sister. I recently stepped down from management position so I can work by myself. It's a bit better.,1
&gt;I love Sertraline I got side effects from it so had to look elsewhere. I'm glad it's working for you though.,1
Thats not a good idea friend,0
"I looked at your post history(sorry, I'm nosy) and what caught my eye was that you were upset that you feel girls don't find you attractive. The key there was you said you don't even bother talking to them. A fear of rejection is what keeps most people single, I think. Even just smiling at a girl when she walks by might make you feel better. If she gives you that, What do you want, weirdo? look, that's her insecurity, and those aren't the kind of people you want in your life anyways. Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. My problem is the opposite, I'm skinny as a rail and short. Upon putting myself out there, I found that some people actually think I'm attractive. You're your own worst critic, so I sincerely doubt your just un-lovably ugly. And about your weight, treat it like an RPG, make a game of losing weight. You'll start to feel better about yourself the more you lose. It can be kind of fun to work on yourself, especially when you start to see results. I was talking to my parents the other day, and calorie counting apparently worked wonders on them. Do some research and see what's best for you, I'm no doctor. Hope this helps.",1
"Every day. Depression dulls your physical emotions. On the inside I may be screaming and balling my eyes out, but I physically let it out when I try. The only times I cry are when I have an extremely deep thought that hits me hard and ball out of nowhere for literally 5 seconds before I pull myself together. Another 5 seconds later like nothing even happened...",1
"Sometimes the suffering gets too much, you know? I'm in a similar situation to you.",1
No. Who are you? Why do you need to die?,0
"Don't fuck up your education. I ended up getting kicked out of the Swedish equivalent of high school at 17 because I stopped attending classes as I progressivly got worse. I ended up getting a lot better the last two years but I'm now approaching my mid 20's with fuck all to show for, which has made me start feeling pretty bad again as I'm trying to play catchup. If i just finished that shit I could at least be at university now... fuck me.",1
"I don't eat, I just drink soda.",1
"Yep. At this point, I find that having opinions, especially controversial ones, are too tiring. What's even the point of getting worked up and angry?",1
I want to sign up to that as well.,1
please don't. I'm telling you. Just don't. Think about your loved one. Seek help from professionals. Try to rationalize everything.,0
Your friends probably know what going through and can help you. discourage help that you know you can get if you need to talk to someone then tell them. I know it can get hard and I hope your Day the worst.,0
"agree more, life is suffering sadly",1
Well everyday is a new day to start over,0

Hey sorry things are blank for you just hold in there and try to find something unique about yourself or make something and give it a purpose in your life. motivation have to come from inside yourself alone it can be other places or times,1
"Not seasonal, but it gets worse in the winter",1
I don't really understand what you mean. What exactly do you need help with?,0
"Oh oh, I know! Youthful enthusiasm for life is great and when your world is like that, it's great! And you live life without reservation. Theeen you get older and wiser and sadder because life is hard and oddly enough that freedom you dreamed of having as a kid was actually what you had, weirdly enough, as a kid.",0
"I love how nice people are to each other in this sub. It's really amazing, I wish I would see this type of support in real life more often.",1
I guess people just are born or moulded into different mindsets and a lot of people unfortunately got a shitty one where they struggle to be happy,1
You know you did the right thing. Be proud of that.,1
"Good for you! I know for me, speaking up for myself can be hard. But it's a step in the journey!",1
"Yep. Shame, guilt and regret are my primary emotions.",1
Yep and they never do,1
"not really a form of depression, but it can definitely be a symptom of it. Feeling that you are worthless, a burden, a failure, are all very common to those suffering from depression. What separates it from simply having low self esteem, which many people do, are whether or not you have the other symptoms associated with depression. Things like lack of energy and interest, hopelessness about the future, difficulty sleeping/eating/focusing, suicidal thoughts; experiencing these things on a consistent basis for weeks/months/years is definitely indicative of some sort of depression. Take some time and think about how you feel and been causing it, Do some research into your thoughts and what others say about it. If you decide you need or want help, be afraid to reach out to others and communicate your troubles. I wish you the best of luck, you got this.",1
Honesty this is how I feel... I'm currently making a plan too... don't plan on being here for too much longer in all honesty,1
I promise it's not the answer. You're at a low point right now. Things will get better you really just have to wait. Call +18002738255 if you feel really bad. Do you see a therapist?,1
My suicidal thoughts are getting worse on Zoloft. Im currently on 75mg. My doctor warned me it was a possibility. If that starts happening make sure you call your doctor asap. I take Lamictal and Buspar with the Zoloft. My combination of medication along with my bipolar disorder could be causing my side effects I'm not sure.,1
"I think everyone has good characteristics to them. Everyone's good at something. Your mind won't buy it, I know, but there's a ton of stuff you've been doing longer successfully than anyone else has: your life, and everything in it. I don't know about you but I know you're good at something, not that you have a particular gifted talent but you do have a strong suit of some kind that you can hone in some way to your advantage. I believe everyone can find their if they try.",0
"I suppose it depends on how deep the pattern is, something that help some people is to use a calendar and write down things to do during which hours everyday in advance and try to force yourself to not break the schedule. Doesn't work for me but i know that it works for some people. The most important part i'd say is to find a goal to strive towards.",1
Being a wagecuck is hard I feel you,1
What's making you want to? I feel like this sometimes.,1
"well maybe there's something that made u feel better for a while, so u felt like you're getting better. Find that shit, don't let your progress go for nothing. I'm rooting for u buddy",0
Maybe try and cook some noodlesor rice at home for now. Oatmeal? Potatos? Beans? There should be something edible in your house that doesn't require you to go outside.,0
"I know what you mean. Seems like it'll never get better, it just gets worse even though it doesn't seem like it could get any worse. Sucks.",1
Only if it detects any sort of input. Computers are actually pretty stupid by themselves.,0
"yea I'm literally in the same boat. sometimes I find something I love and become so happy. but once I finish and remember real life, I just fall back into the rut.",1
What do you want someone to care about?,0
Could you call child protective services?,0
"No, I basically did this and dug myself into a much deeper hole to climb out of.",1
"You are not useless. I used to think the same, but I have always been good at writing and research. I decided to start freelancing my services, and I do quite well for myself. It's no replacement to a full time job just yet, but I really enjoy the freedom and receiving positive client feedback. Everyone has something to offer, just have to make a start..",1
"That depends on where you are in the world. Where I'm at in the USA, BHR (Behavioral Health Resources) would be the place to inquire. I'm pretty sure they're nation wide but lack the resources to really help many people though. Mental health care system is a joke, especially in the low/no income sector. Worth pursuing if you're in need. Just might take a little time and patience.",1

are we the same person?,1
"Same here man. I hope your life gets better and that your day is fantastic, you really deserve it. I know that it's a struggle because I go through the same thing every day - do you ever laugh but feel like it's just not reaching your eyes anymore? That's me every day. I can't say that it 100% for certain gets better, but it COULD get better and that's what really motivates me every day.",1
Don't be hurt. All dating sites are money scams in disguise. The success rate of finding an actual person on there is very low. Majority of OkCupid profiles are bots and fake accounts with stolen pictures.,1
"Life is not what happens to you - it's how you react to it. If you feel sorry for yourself, and most depressed people do, it's because they decide that there is a payoff in doing it. It's showing sympathy for a person, and you're the person, because you aren't getting it from anyone else. It all comes down to what comes after that. You can give up and never try again, or you can take that feeling and extend it into the future: - Imagine feeling this way, and doing nothing about it, for a year. 5 years. 10 years. What has your life become? - Now imagine what your life would be like if you forced yourself to get of bed, brush your teeth, went to the store or coffee shop, talked to someone, helped someone, every day. Now imagine doing that for a year. 5 years. 10 years. NOW what is your life like?",0
That's good. If only everybody around me wouldn't lie every chance they could.,1
I envy you. I can only sleep like 4 hours a day,1
"I'm not entirely certain what reaction you're getting, but I hope you'll give those around you a little slack if they can't be as openly receptive and caring as you need at first. I'm sort of the designated problem solver in my circle, so quite a few of my friends come to me for advice and sympathy. It's never, never a burden. Instead, it's an honor. They trust me with their secrets, their problems, and value my opinion enough to ask for it. Reverse the situation. Aren't you glad when someone comes to you? The thing is, not everyone is built for that. Especially, I have found, it can sort of weird people out when the Rock, the Stable One, the One Person In This Messed Up World Who Has Their Stuff Together needs help. I mean, here's the person they go to and they rely on when they need support... and that person needs support. Suddenly you're not Superman anymore and it can be a bit disconcerting. Perhaps try introducing A problem at a time, slowly, and seeing if they can get used to you also being a normal human with issues. Good luck!!",1
"I am in the exact same place. I've lost two jobs and two boyfriends in the last year (2 jobs in the last 6 months). My ex lives two blocks away and I see him every time I leave the house. I never see my friends. I live alone and money is running out. I can't imagine finding a new job (my background makes it impossible) or finding new love (I'm too old). But you are not alone. Know that I am here and you can PM me and we can be there for each other, for whatever it's worth.",1
"Sometimes you really need to be reminded of that other side and that you will in fact return to it. Don't make any big decisions when in the heat of the moment. Focus on other things (TV shows, artistic endeavours, school, etc) and return once you've cooled off. Good on you for reaching out for help, my friend. Despite these people not knowing you, we're all in this together. Keep your head up",1
Over thinking and running away from myself.Or everything because I don't know what would be better for me.,1
"No. Not having a social life isn't a terminal diagnosis. Why kill yourself due to lack of social life if you could eventually obtain one? Life is not pass/fail. It's not about getting a certain grade for social life, or any other aspect of life for that matter. You are not a failure. Not having friends worsens depression, depression inhibits the ability to make friends. It's a cycle that needs to be broken, and I recommend getting medical help to tackle depression. Eventually you will get to a point where it is easier to make/maintain relationships, even if it that progress seems small at first. Keep up the fight.",1
"in the exact same boat, my ex just left me because of my depression, and I had told her how I had attempted before but had those thoughts since which was like 4 years ago but she freaked out and constantly kept thinking I was going to do something and now I never wanna tell people about any of my depression problems again.",1
Yeah. How I wish I had a good job to support my parents. How I wish I had a place on my own to focus on relationships. How I wish I was my love-interest's focus. So yeah most things don't come out as planed here either.,1

I feel as if everyday is a struggle for self acceptance even by myself. Everyday is a day where I am buffeted by my own worthlessness. I try my best, I do. I try my very best to get through. Every day is a drag, but at least its a drag and not a standstill. After a while I forget people exist, really. It's just me and my depression. I don't need any more love from my peers after some time.",1

"So far it hasn't gotten better for me, I've just come to accept it. Things that when I was younger would've made me cry or get really mad now just miff me. For example today I found out that I got ripped off over $130 because of an irrevocable clerical error - that's about 1/3rd of what I make in a week, and I should be furious because this kind of thing happens far too often. But what good will that do me?",1

"One of my friends got better. Like, not just temporarily felt better, but like, actually got completely *better*. Honestly I was kind of shocked. I mean, I guess we all dream of someday getting better, but I'd never really heard of that actually happening before. She lost a ton of weight, got into a happy relationship, and has half a dozen dogs. And she's *normal* now. Like, not depressed or anxious anymore. She's happy. I'm really happy for her, not just because she's my friend and I'm glad she's not suffering anymore (although that's part of it), but also because it means that getting better really is possible and it's not just some made up dream. But at the same time I feel really awful and sad when I talk to her, because when I hear about how wonderfully her life is going now and how great she's doing, I feel like a worthless failure mentioning my own life. We used to bond over talking about how awful mental illness can be, and I felt like she was a light in the darkness, someone who was weathering the storm with me and who truly understood my pain. Now I feel ashamed because she's moved on and I haven't. I feel like bringing up how I feel now would only make her feel guilty and awkward. It feels like as my friends start to get better and move on with their lives while I remain stuck here making no progress, there's no longer any place for me.",1
Okay... Do you want to talk about it?,1
"You arent. I can only speak for myself here but I sometimes get stable enough to motivate myself to lessen my consume of electronics and be productive instead and read, tidy up and continue learning the language ive been working on. However those ups usually dont last long cause its easy to trigger me into collapsing again. The only way out is gettin a potent therapist or the right pills I guess",1
I'm with you. Let's take it one day at a time. What can we do today that will help?,1
I feel the same. I wish I could see all the people in public who feel this way because I bet a lot of the people like you or me who feel like this could be friends because we understand something about eachother that no one who felt that way understands.,1
"I know exactly how you feel. I can't get myself to study or do any work. Sometimes it really makes me worry about my future, and other times I think Am I even planning on staying here that long?",1
Is this supposed to be a joke? I apologize if it isn't.. just sort of seems that way to me,0
getting an interview is hardest part and you achieved that! good luck!,1
"Don't know if it helps in the long run but apps with binaural beats might help. They worked the first time for me, but my body got used to it later on.",1
Can't really explain why but it is just a basic need,0
"I think people are meant to regularly bathe. Like we have probably been bathing while still hairy and grunting. I wasn't raised the best; one thing is that I was never taught to bathe regularly. It was normal to bathe once every 2-4 weeks growing up. Basically, I never had it ingrained into me, which led to being super hygienic to the point of irritation and skin problems during puberty, and complete abandonment of hygiene during my intense depressive periods. So during these periods I would go as long as I could possibly can without showering until it was literally affecting everything I did, usually 4-6 weeks. My dirtiness would get into my eyes, and they would burn like hell. I got more skin problems from the build up of dead skin: in grown hairs, dry scaly skin, acne, etc. My hair had issues too: unhealthy and wiry possibly from an unhealthy scalp and follicles and dandruff. My dick had some infection and itched like hell. I also looked like shit too and was never prepared for events that forced me to go outside which made everything worse (I would hide and wait out people who potentially could see or interact with me, for example). I also was dirty and made my surroundings just as dirty, and I smelled bad, but luckily I don't have volatile BO. *Anyways*, just saying that there are some serious consequences to poor hygiene that I wish someone told me about. Thanks mom.",1
changing medication and literally have to go cold turkey. These withdrawals are not fun,0
In my experience Telling my parents was the best thing I couldve done.I wasnt myself the past couple months and they knew something was up they are very supportive and want to help me get through my depression/anxiety go for it the first step to the road to recovery is admitting you need help.,1
"be spending my time reading books. If in another world, I think about the real one.",0
Idk that :) made me smile haha,0
"A therapist is never a bad idea. Do you have the option to look for different work? How long have you been there? For myself, I need frequent change or things get stagnant and I get frustrated.",1
"If pushing you to do it, yeah file a complaint. If they know suicidal and just their mindset, I see you benefiting from it at all. assuming in the USA.",0
What's on your mind? &lt;3,0
"Yeah, I resonate with a lot of what you're saying. It's only on a place like here or a depression support group that you would find others that feel this way. Let me ask you this: what do you find joy or distraction in? Tell me everything you have tried.",1
Anything you want to talk about dude,1
"I'm on mirtazapine at the moment and, I too, am having issues dealing with the fatigue. I Spoke to my psychiatrist about it and they said that mirtazapine stimulates both an anti-histamine effect and a noroadrenaline effect. The anti-histamine effect causing the fatigue. However, once you start taking 30mg daily the noroadrenaline effect outweighs the anti-histamine effect and you should feel a lot less fatigue.",1
"It's confusing to feel like this a reason to feel like this. You seem to have multiple reasons to feel this way just according to your post/comment history. According to how you described your birthday and vacation, there are reasons you didn't enjoy them. If something sucks, it sucks. It's not your fault you don't enjoy something that sucks and shouldn't force yourself to try to enjoy something that sucks, because it won't stop sucking to you because you think that it shouldn't.",1
"Please, break out a diary and just write down every detail you can about how you feel and what you're thinking, if you still feel good, it'll help later.",0
"Funny how pharases like that say everything you know, give an answer why you are depressed and then ask you why are depressed.",1
"Luckily, I'm content at night. Can lay in the dark and do nothing. It's peaceful",1
"It won't kill you definitely. You should be fine, but it's still harmful. I would recommend visiting the hospital, especially if you feel bad. Stay safe anyway, wish you all the best.",1
"Well, if you looked at how those people spend their time. It would probably be very different than how you spend your time. So it kind of makes sense that they would have different results and resulting feelings about their life since their life is so different. But the good news is, you can have a happy, fuller life too. What you should do is list out the top five things you don't like about your life. Then you should spend some time working on the one that is bothering you the most. In my experience, when I was unhappy with my life it was because I was neglecting some part of my life that was really nagging me. Rooting for you! Hope this helps.",1
"I get angry at myself as well, along with all other negative Emotion and toxic feelings. Lately i have been trying to better myself by reading,and browsings like deciding to do better/get disciplined/get motivated. Some posts are really refreshing to read. Maybe you could try to find something to distract you. Learn a language or skill or something. Spending time with friends. Make new friends. It is good that you have some long term friendship. short term friendship is not bad too.  Dont know if you do this or not. A mistake i made is that I used to watch a lot of comedy. Comedians would make a lot of self deprecating jokes, they would say things like : nobody likes them, they are unattractive, got terrible personalities, they have messed up life, blablabla in a very funny way. And i actually took it serious (by this i dont mean i get offend by jokes ) And proud that i am relate to that. So i always lookdown on myself. But i stopped doing that and try not to read posts on depression/ 2meirl /other sub that might bring me down.",1
Nightmares would even work. They increase my chance of getting killed and are just as meaningless as everything else.,1
the two are combined. The happy moments in the past breaking my heart while I have nothing to look forward to. No hope no prospects.,1
"If any consolation, she probably cares about you a lot if she stayed with you for 3 years. got her own mental health to take care of, and okay. I hope it bring you down too much. This is a good opportunity for you to focus on your own mental health as well. not saying probable, but maybe she still likes you and would be willing to give it another try when/if you find ways to cope with your depression. take a lot of self introspection and time, however. Stay strong. Get better. Take baby steps. get there when ready.",1
"Great way of putting it. Life is just so exhausting. I can't leave the house without caffeine, I have no interests, I just feel like an empty battery. Hopefully one day you can find both strength and endurance.",1
"When I felt this way, I came to the conclusion that I didn't know who I was without these feelings. I didn't know what I liked anymore, would I be empty without this sadness? That sort of thought process, it was a lot of fear that drove me away from help. It's natural to be afraid of things changing. But when you feel ready to, these changes are for the better.",1
"Yea this past summer ive not been up to much but walking a couple hours a day through my city. it's nice until I can't stop and keep telling myself, i'll go home at the next subway stop until 1 in the morning. A week or so ago I saw a movie an hour into a walk on a whim, and then walked another 3 hours, from the West Village to the Upper East Side",1
"Similar thing happened to me when I looked into the mirror a while back. I like to think that boy is just a home in his birth country. He came with me and my mum to another country, a new life but he didn't like it so he went back home.",1
Well I didn't sugar coat it just say it straight out. I don't see any other way of telling someone you trust and love.,1
"That sucks, but believe me, self medicating only makes things worse.",1
so sorry that you are going through this as well. Is there anyone you might be able to talk with? I know waking up in the morning with thoughts of suicide can just ruin a day. Maybe if able you can try to do something fun or relaxing when you get home. I know it probably help right now but maybe it can help ease the thoughts for a bit. I wish I knew something that you could do while at work but I sorry. If you want to talk feel free to pm me. also at work with the same thoughts.,1
"Same, we're all here for you, take a deep breath and talk to us!",1
I've dealt with not knowing if I'm hearing voices as well. What's your story and I'll share mine? Maybe we can help each other.,1
I'd raise a glass with you but the doc warned against drinking with cymbalta.,0
"Why do you go to that places? Why staying? I feel the same when I go dancing, I dance salsa, Bachata and kizomba (mostly) from 2 years, I go to the night, maybe that night is boring and I want to go home, but then I always find a reason to stay, the same I went there, dancing,feeling my self. So, why do you go there? Staying with friends? Being thoughtless?",1
"Replace sack of shit with failure and that's about right. I have no idea how so many people generally do well in their lives, you know - relationships, careers. I often think that it's an inevitability that some people are just meant to fail at everything throughout their lives as a way for the world to create a balance for all the successful, content people out there...an example of yin and yang in practice.",1
"Yea, but it's not because I feel like I don't deserve happiness. I go through periods of isolation usually if I feel overwhelmed by life. I just need everything to stop. I also have suffered depression for about 20 years and know that it's not fun to be around me during a flare up. And during deep depression episodes I can't handle other people really.",1
"I sleep, a lot. It actually takes practice to sleep a lot, the trick is to try your best not to wake up. You want to sleep long hours in one sitting, otherwise you will have problem falling asleep. Nothing is better than sleep. Sometimes I dream, and regardless what I dream it's always better than reality.",1
Have you looked into therapy?,0
"At least we don't have the horrid fear of our own mortality like non-depressives. I asked a question about aging and losing looks on another and most posted they didn't mind losing their looks but facing mortality was difficult. It really made me think, Wow, so there is an upside to depression. I look forward to dying.",0
i don't know what to do i am feeling suicidal right now .,0
Everything is wrong with people.,1
"Yeah, unfortunately the side effects from them can be really strong, especially if its your first time trying them, I lost a lot of sleep from stomach pains when I was first prescribed them. That said they side-effects should pass fairly quickly as your body adapts to the meds but if it is causing you a serious problem, talk to your doctor, they can often start you off on a smaller dosage and work their way up to a level that can help you.",1
"For past trauma, I found EMDR pretty effective. It's a technique used in therapy. It's basically designed for PTSD, which sounds like youre dealing with. That's all I can think of. Regardless, I hope you can get some solace.",1
"was on fluoxetine (i think is how its spelt) for 9 years or so. definitely helped but i found that in a 2 week period im having 10 good days and then 4 severely bad days. so i quit them 9 months ago, best thing i did. it really clears your head to be off them. but by all means if you have the chance to try them, do it. thats just how i reacted with it. good luck mate.",1
I had a choice of going to jail or being held for 3 days. I went to jail lol.,1
"I've been here. I know it's hard to see past the dark clouds now and I know it's cheesy but it DOES get better. I've been in and out of psych wards for suicide attempts my entire life. Where I am now, what I've worked towards, has made everything I've gone through worth it. I am so glad I failed.  There is more to experience in this life than you could imagine and most difficult things are temporary and will pass. Hang in there. Work on yourself. Do the things that make you happy, make you feel something, as long as they aren't harmful. Spend time with your family, your friends or animals. Maybe with yourself or nature. Happiness really is in the little things.",1
Pm me if ya wanna talk,1
"You are young and still have time to make something of yourself. The first step to feel better is to tell someone you trust. It can be a parent, grandparent or school counselor.",1
"Hate to say it, but it sounds like you might have a bad dr. One time during a depressive episode I happened to tell my dr everything that was going on with me (similar to your situation) he started me on a new medication but did not mess around with a lower dose. Just a thought, that maybe she shouldn't have started you on the lowest dose assuming she knew you had attempted, that is.",1
Why would she want you to close the curtains?,0
I guess it makes a person more defensive against other people but it really depends on the person? Some people enjoy being alone and some people can't stand it,0
"That's feels right there.. you sound like a sick and tired of being sick and tired situation.. You try any of the A's? In same place as you, totally understand. Not into the A's, but helps some people...",1
who wouldnt want to show up to that?? they lame,0
"I feel the same way. At least I did for a while. I talked to my doctor a couple years ago and basically I learned that depression is a *mental illness* and you can literally have no reason to be depressed, like myself, and still feel like absolute shit and want to cry all the time. I'm pretty sure we were just born with it and you can only treat it. I myself am still trying to fight it but It's only been maybe like 8 years so I'm sure it will get better eventually. Just stay strong my dude. If you ever need anyone talk to you can PM me. I stay up all hours of the night on the east coast.",1
It's the otherway around man!,0
"Same boat. It sucks. Hang in there cause it gets better for 99% of people! Things that make me feel better: -an episode of 'this american life' -a walk around the block or hiking -weed -making music or drawing or just being creative -journaling -broad city -talking about it. You have us, and there are therapy apps.",1
"I feel you. I just about jumped off a building a few weeks back, it scares the shit out of me",1
"Yea why I don't text anymore. All people want to hear is fake, surface, superficial shit.",1
Always wanted to be painter. Unfortunately my drawings are not even worth. I do enjoy drawing and painting even though it is abysmal.,1
Or like an ex because a fucking pain in the ass.,0
"had very violent and psychotic thoughts my whole life. been very violently raised and I know how to turn it off. But! What learned that makes me feel better is just thoughts. They go away. For us depressed, the thoughts have tighter grips on our conscious and therefore stick around longer. I say get busy doing something you like. Or go outside right now and sprint down the block. I promise, if you do that, feel better. I promise.",1
"Laughter is a hugely important way of dealing with life, in my opinion. Sometimes I also make myself laugh and realise life is not too bad afterall. Keep finding the funny edge to everything and you can cope with anything.",1
"The thing that puts me off on reincarnation is that in the next few decades the quality of life on earth will probably tank pretty hard due to the effects of global warming. Granted, a cat or a dog would probably care very little about that Being reborn in a different, better universe with magic abilities though? Hell yeah, give me that shit. Eternal slumber is fine too tho",0
"Well I'll be here if you'd like to talk, though I may be too young as I'm only 14, though I understand what your feeling &amp; it's terrible. Hopefully it'll get better for us sooner or later, anyway I wish you the best of luck",1
"Yes. Another thing I can relate to. Had a small conversation with one close friend a few hours ago and having to watch my chat history in Whatsapp made me almost tear up. Aside from said friend, there are no real chats from the last days. The rest are from weeks ago, talking with people from college about stuff university-wise. That pretty much makes me hate looking at my phone. Or even more ...",1
"hi there, forgive me if I'm wrong with regards to what you are referring to. How I understand your statement is that you try to relate to others but rather do the latter. If this is the case, I want to let you know that even though sometimes you feel you are compelled to relate to other because of societal pressures, you really don't and it depends to what extent. It's important to be who you are and be with people where you can be who you are. But that doesn't mean your depressed you is who you are as a person. Your depression is only a part of who you are, not your defining being. Don't define yourself as 'a depressed person' but more so 'a person that has depression right now at this stage of my life.' Because depression goes away or can be managed very well where it doesn't intrude on your life in a daily or constant basis. You are much more than your depression. Try to take smell steps that you are comfortable with and learn some coping strategies in managing depressed feelings. Ideally it'll be great if you can see a therapist but I understand that has it's own restrains. The key thing is to never give up on yourself because when you believe, there will be a way out of this. I always tell others that healing isn't easy but it's worth it because you are worth it, whether you feel it right now or not.",1
"Same actually. But hopefully they wipe everybody out, because radiation is not fun for anybody",1
"Yes, this is how my life is right now. Dreams that just torture. I honestly believe that humans were programmed to forget dreams. You participate in this perfect personal world where you can do anything, and then, every morning, you are jolted back into a crushing reality that never changes. It would drive everyone insane. It's driving me insane.",1
"I've been homeless. If you have a car, job, and gym membership, it doesn't have to be so bad.",1
"Life is like a wave. There are ups and downs. One day, no matter how hard been, your life will get better again. But until then, see all the bad stuff that is going on in your life as because in reality, there is no such thing as or You define if it is. Try to find the postive part in your current situation. There is always a reason, why some things happen. The reason is, to teach you a lesson. For example: if you have no friends (like me), see it as negative. Try to find the lesson behind this experience. In this case, life wants to tell you, that loneliness is not what you, in your deepest self, want. You need persons such as friends around you. Take a desicion now, that you want to be lonely anymore, and life will listen to you and bring you friends again, and if it work, try to know, why it (i know the answer, but a bit complicated (msg me if you want to know)) and what the lesson in this experience is. Also: Life is like a mirror. If you feel lonely inside, the outside world will deliver you that loneliness. pretty simple. So if you want to be lonely anymore, try not to feel lonely (i know fking hard, but you can reach that with more knowledge about the truth (msg me if you want to know more). If you feel lonely inside, that means, that the outside world will automaticlly deliver you NOT-loneliness, which means new persons will enter your life.  Oh also: Life is a paradox. right with love being complicated, but at the same time, the easiest thing you could possibly imagine. If you understand something, just reply :)",0
Start with finding a job/career that sounds interesting and look into it.,0
"I thought about how should I write my note to make my parents and siblings feel better about my death before. But then I realized there's nothing I can say, they would be sad no matter what. Then I give up. Damn. I wish me and people's memory about me could just disappear.",1
"Freshman in high school or college? If HS, you can get a work permit at 15 I think. You're supposed to have one as long as you're working and under 18. As for finding one at that age most people I know went into food or retail. Coffee shops, fast food, some with cars did pizza delivery. Theaters usually higher younger people. They're simple jobs that don't require a lot of training and younger employees help keep younger crowds coming in. There should be someone at your school like a counselor with info on work permits. Edit: its also great that you want to work. Having the money can give you more breathing room with bills and you can start building some retirement money. Plus having the experience will help get better jobs. Just remember you don't have to save everything. If all you do is work and your money goes right back out to food/bills/rent/etc, work will become a burden. Put aside a little bit each paycheck as a whatever fund. It wont be much at first but after a few months you'll have a good bit of change set aside. Wanna go for a weekend getaway? Do it. Looking for a new TV. Buy it. I usually set aside $100 month and typically buy something I'd wanted after a few months but couldn't normally justify. Worked out well. I still had some other money to go out to eat or do things, but I got a big reward every few months.",0

"Because depression isn't the same for everyone, so there is no 'one size fits all' cure for everyone. And some of the things you mentioned can be downright harmful for some people. For instance, tough love can potentially push a suicidal person over the edge. There's a reason those things are mentioned in the sidebar. Treatment should be left to the professionals to deal with on an individual basis. This sub is more of a support group, meant for encouraging each other to hang on, to keep fighting, and to point people in the right direction if and when they seek professional help. I'm sincerely glad you beat depression. What worked for you, though, may not work for everyone else (or even anyone else). It's a very personal and individual experience. And that's where you should have gone with this submission. You should've just shared your story. Talked about your depression, talked about your journey through it and how you beat it. Instead, you rolled it out like a sales pitch for snake oil. This is dangerous territory, because when you say things like I beat depression and you can too, here's how..., you are selling people hope. If it doesn't work and somebody spirals down and harms themselves or worse, even in one single instance, you are at least partially to blame for selling them that false hope. Again, that's why we leave treatment to the professionals. Please, I can't stress enough that you follow the rules and guidelines in the sidebar. They are there for a reason.",0

"That solves nothing and will hurt your loved ones to no end. The road to recovery takes a long time and is so much hard work, but when you get there everything will change. Seeing a doctor and getting antidepressants is the first step. The second step is finding something, ANYTHING, to get out of bed for. For me it was my cat. I would go without eating for days because I didn't want to leave my house, and I didn't want a delivery man to see the state of my house and myself. When my cat ran out of food I would suck it up and go to the store so he wouldn't be hungry. When he curled up with me I felt good, at a time that nothing else felt good. He passed a few months ago, but he flat out saved my life and I'm constantly grateful. Life can be overwhelming, especially when you feel the way you do. But you can make it better.

"Depression is no common cold. There are people that live with it for decades. The solution to controlling, or ridding oneself of depression varies, person-to-person. So, perhaps medication works for Bentley, whereas Allison exhibits no improvements despite numerous boosts to her dose. Maybe Allison has an abusive partner that's affecting her mental state. In that situation she would benefit from distancing herself, as well as seeking professional counseling/therapy...But I digress. In your life, it might be productive to identify that things that worsen your mood. Maybe you need to change your environment, catch up on debt, etc.",0

"You're not evaluating yourself or being overly critical of your personality. There's no feelings of anxiety or any bipolar fluctuations of emotions. In fact, zero emotion. Just peaceful, not happy, not sad. No neurotic thinking or urgency to evaluate every thought going through the mind. Basically, you don't take yourself or life so personally or too seriously. You feel light, not heavy. You have expectations and desires in life, but you don't overly invest your mind and emotion in them. You're just...Cool, even keeled.",0

If she doesn't want to talk, don't leave, just sit there or lay there with her so she doesn't feel alone. When someone wants to die, they feel alone, they feel like no one cares. But you obviously care about her, so show it. Just be there for her.

I can't sleep, can't concentrate and have no ambition in life anymore and apparently that's my fault. I just don't care",1
I disagree... I think depression is normal and so is wanting to fuck shit up because you feel like a turd. The hard part is trying to control those feelings.,0

"Parents pass on their coping skills to their kids. If they have unhealthy ways of dealing with life, it's pretty likely their kids will have issues in that area too.

"Dating a depressed person is like dating a child with temper tantrums. I suggest you to focus on your own happiness first, then be there to support them when they need you. You are ultimately two individuals with individual needs and ideals. Live and let live, support and be supported are the key. You are at this point just dating and you must remember that you shouldn't give more than what you must. It should be a harmony where equal emotional exchange is the mandate. Otherwise it takes a toll lime it is right now and if things go sour it will be your fault and you are bound to hurt the most because you gave more than you had and got lesser in return. Balance is key, communication is the order. Respect and understanding is the borderline",1

"The amount of plumber and garbage man jokes they made about me when I told them I wasn't going to uni. Fucking hell, and they blatantly laughed for minutes on end while i was faking my own. And they would bring it up at least once every time they fucking saw me. oh we were just joking man cmon when I jokingly but not so jokingly said I was going to kill myself. Glad I cut off ties with them. Made my depression like 5 times worse during that period. Still hurts. Were my only friends",1

Having depression AND anxiety is a double slam because (in my case) anxiety and depression are almost the same...it's hard to tell the difference.

THEY WILL FORGET YOU. so stay the fuck alive, and make them notice you because you deserve to be noticed. worthlessness usually stems from lack of accomplishment. if that applies to you, start learning or doing something. anything that interests you. just give it your all. but don't die just yet. you will, eventually, so why hurry. so for now, look in the mirror every time you feel you're alone, and remind yourself you're not.",1
Tell me about it. Good luck in your search!,0

Yes. I experience this very frequently. Some days I'll wake up feeling fairly good (hardly ever ecstatic though) and others I want to stay inside the whole day and worse.,1

"Do you mean your bad days feel worse or do you mean you feel bad and good at the same time? Ever since this thing started for me I had fluctuations over the course of the day, days and weeks, where I would have lethargy, tiredness and depression in the mornings for example and then good feelings and even excitement and a lot of energy in the evenings. Also I have very good days/ weeks and suddenly it hits me again. Did you have constant depression and how bad was it?",1
I was one year in collage but I realize that I didn't like how we studied there. I dicided I would try to studied something related with airplanes because I always love it. Now I have ended my studies and I'm going to do an internship in an airline. The most important thing is doing what you love.,1
"i know if it could be considered a stimulant, but i take sertraline for my depression and i get fair results. I also used to take vyvanse in combination with sertraline but i must warn against it. It usually left me numb and unable to enjoy anything.",1

If you want someone to talk to I will be here. You can PM me if you want,1
"Lmao, I love it when my asshole father tells me this. Yeah, it really helps. **Like I didn't try THAT for the past 4 years.**",1
"Hi friend! :) I'm really sorry you're in such pain :( sometimes the people we have around us can't see the pain we're in because they don't want to (they may see it, not know how to help us, and are afraid to because it may cause them pain). This may seem like useless advice, but it can greatly help if you tell the other people exactly how you're feeling and ask them to try and help you. Nobody will ever be inside your head and able to experience exactly what you are feeling, but by talking to them and letting them know, you can help them to understand you. Sometimes we have to do the hardest part of reaching out ourselves. I had to tell my best friend I was feeling suicidal, but by telling her she helped me turn my life around. She just didn't realise. It's never easy to do, but I can promise you that you are so much stronger than you know, and there are always people willing to listen and to try to understand what you're going through. Lastly, I hope you don't die. Not until you've been able to live the life that you want, the life that you deserve to have. I'm sending you love and luck.",1
I take melatonin and that works,1
This is really true. I showed that i cared about 2 friends at school (2 girls) and now they think they can make me do everything. It makes me really sad because i feel being used by everyone,1
I'm around if you need someone to chat with. I'm sorry you're feeling sad. Sometimes it's such a painful and unbearable feeling.,1
Same honestly. Half the time I feel like overreacting and because of that I feel like a little bitch which brings me down more.,1
I feel like this all the time and I am never sure what I am looking for. I really wish I had a passion in life like some people have. Sadly I have not found it yet. I never felt that strongly about anything. Maybe I need girlfriend.Maybe I just need more friends. Maybe I need a different job.Maybe I need to to work things out with my farther. Or maybe I just need to be able to really talk to someone.,1
Why cant you get it treated? (excuse my ignorance),0
summed up my feelings in a few sentences. Every. Single. Waking moment. Is shit. Hobbies help. Exercise help. Talking to friends is now a chore. literally all shit.,1
"That has to be tough. It's different strokes for different folks of course but I might have a suggestion. I find my depression tends to be racing negative thoughts. My understanding is that there are two default brain modes, one is random thought, day dreaming for example, and the other is processing. So you need to switch from day dreaming to processing, and that is hard for everyone. Start with meditation. Close your eyes for 5min and focus on your breathing. If your thoughts drift from breathing, then shut it down n snap back to breathing. Don't get emotional, just stay calm and focus on breathing. When finished, move everything that is a distraction away from you. No phone, no internet if possible, just clear that shit away and start studying as if it is your breathing. This focus is just like a muscle and the more you flex the stronger it will become. Don't expect to focus for hours on end, but try to catch yourself when you drift and get back to that focus. Also make studying fun, or less boring. Take notes, highlight pages, repeat the things you read. Most importantly, try telling a story with what you are learning. It's a strong method for memorization. People with ordinary memories use stories and codes to memorize full decks of cards in minutes. Good luck!",1

It may suck in hindsight. But her hair will grow back and you'll have a story to tell. It happens. You have to look at kids as things of wonder. They learn the hard way. They always will. Just be happy that they're alive to make those mistakes. Love them when they make mistakes. You're their to protect them,1
"Exercise has always helped when I am as you said. If you would do anything to feel better, then muster everything you have for high intensity exercise. At least 45 minutes for three time per week. I get it, the last thing you want to do is exercise, but if you will do anything to get out of it, just do it.",1
Care to talk? Feel free to message me any time.,1
not me. i hate cold.,0
"I have to be honest with you, because it's very important: I believe friends are very important. But it's extremely hard to make friends, I know. But talking to people about how you feel helps alot, it does with me. It gives me purpose, dreams and hope. Friends can come from anywhere at any time. If you ever want to let off some steam, bounce something off another person or seek advice, never hesitate to write to me. I'm your friend, and I'll never let anything happen to you, if I can help it. Please talk to me if you need it, it can save lives, in more ways than you'd think. Have a very merry Christmas, know you are not alone.",1

There are many services that local and state governments provide to help people such as yourself find work. The cool thing is they are totally free and they can provide a support system and will work with you to find a job that works for you! I would suggest looking online for these services and sending your information to them. Stay strong and I love you!!,1
I feel alone also. Although people want to date me I always feel they are just using me for my appearance and do not care about anything I have to say or care about me irl,1
"Take small steps. Indulge in little things that make you happy (or at least used to make you happy!), such as food, or some nice tea. When you consume those, try to focus on the taste, on the pleasant feelings. It's just one example, it can be something else. A walk around the neighborhood maybe. A nice bath. Etc. Generally speaking, be kind to yourself.",0
"Yeah, I have to agree, she sounds like an absolute moron. In some ways, I realise this isn't gonna be easy for you to believe yourself, but it may even be helpful that this has come out because it sounds like she just wouldn't have been a reliable friend. There are other (much better) people out there. Just try not to actively worry about it too much, or really try and find someone, just let it happen if it happens, and if not, don't fret about it.",1
Please don't. Its just not right choice make. There is always something that can be done other than that.,1
Depression is a disorder that you ask for,0
"i read a thing a while back... to paraphrase (badly): Most people think that depressed people are bad at regulating their emotions. But actually, depressed people are great at regulating their emotions; they just always regulate them toward depression. ...When i first read this, i was sitting alone in the dark at 2am listening to Elliot Smith. So, it rang true. It's super hard to do, but if you can force yourself to change your habits (even slightly), your brain actually physically changes with practice.",0

(Never got caught hehe) Anyway, I just felt so.. bored of school and so sick of all the shit that went down there. Instead, I decided to live my life, have fun, sleep, ditch school or do whatever and just live the life as I wanted to. If you cant find motivation in one thing, than find motivation in another.

"I would say plan around your depression. You gotta give yourself more time to do stuff because there will be days where you just do work. If on average you give yourself 2 weeks to do a paper, give yourself 3 weeks and push yourself to work when you have good days. Know that going to be tiring to try to work as soon as your depression temporarily lifts and just take things in small increments. Write a paragraph a day for 3 weeks and or write two paragraphs when you miss a day due to depression and voila! Same results, different pace, depression included and worked around. Practice self care and indulge in the fee things that make you feel okay. stay in your dorm/apartment constantly. Seriously, even if you go to the library for a few hours a day, it helps with isolation. If you like to write, start roleplays with people on geeking or rolemance and reply when you need a break from academic writing. Otherwise indulge in low energy hobbies. And try to eat 2 meals a day even when you feel like it. It makes a difference. Overall, the transition is going to be rough and even more rough for you because of depression so try not to get stuck in a loop of bad habits. Break your routine if not making you feel good and professors are more understanding than not about late assignments and group projects. Be candid with them. Tell them you have the disability accommodations et but working on them. Good luck!!!",1
Good idea. Don't let people treat you like shit and step all over you. You don't need people like that in your life. I'm still kinda passive but I've been trying to have more respect for myself.,1
"Remember that eventually you won't cry, and that you woke up today to experience another day of life. Maybe it wasn't the best day, but tomorrow is a brand new one, and it's going to be ok, whether I'm talking about tomorrow or in an hour or a week, it will be ok. I'm really sorry you are feeling down.",1
"I feel this pretty frequently, although lately it's evolved to wanting to die. It's such a weird feeling to have though, not wanting to be alive or dead.",1
I feel the same. On my lucky days i just happen not to think about it too much. Other days it's just there the entire time. It's tiring.,1
"At least you want to help people! Some love hurting people or just ignoring them, you care and the most important thing.",1
"What's worse is I'm making myself look even uglier because I've stopped caring, which I realise *is* actually worse. People judge me *even harsher*. I'm trying to be okay with being unattractive though. Plenty of people are and they seem to get on fine with life, even if they don't get a partner or whatever.",1
Don't do it. Tell me your story! I'd love to hear.,1
Maybe just around shitty people. I hope you can still make it out of this alive though. at least one person that cares.,1
"I almost broke down crying just then for literally no reason. All of a sudden I started feeling anxiety - had to get up and walk around, knot in my chest, felt like a panic. Was super fucking close to texting my ex, only reason I didn't is because i know it would make me feel fucking shittier",1
like standing behind a glass wall with all of your dreams ahead of you. I know how it feels.,1
Might be a good idea to avoid them for now. Good job on doing your best.,0
"I can appreciate the small things more the smaller and sadder my life gets. A simple hand on my arm in a moment of need means the world to me. And god, it's a beautiful world sometimes. So beautiful it brings me to tears sometimes. Yeah, I'm depressed, lol. :p",1
"As long as your voice, good. Otherwise, this whole class of drugs unfortunately named antipsychotic. Might wanna see a doc..",0
I feel that way often when I go out by myself without my husband or mom with me. So you're not alone. My fear is a combination of the shit my parents told me as a kid and my obsession with crime television. It's a good day when I can go out by myself and be calm.,1

"I was diagnosed with it when I was 15, and I am 22 now. For my antidepressant, I tried lexapro ( which i stopped taking; because, it made my dick stop working), and wellbutrin.. which was alright. My antipsychotic was risperidone.. which I honestly am still dealing with a side affect of it till this day. I'll be honest, I took those combination of drugs for like 2.5 years, and just stopped. I learned how to deal with the symptoms a lot better than I did from years prior.. looking back.. thst could've gone poorly. I'd recommend being open in discussion with your psychiatrist about the effects these drugs are having on your body and your mood. There are quite a few drug combinations for this type of diagnosis, and it would be wise to work dilligently with your psychiatrist until you find the combination for you. Don't be afraid of them changing your meds. They aren't work anyway, so you may as well be open to working with professionals to find something that works for you and your body. I'd also recommend to try being aware as possible if the symptoms, the triggers for those symptoms, and look to grow from them even while on these medications. Keep a close eye out for unwanted side effects. A lot of the medicines they may try to prescribe would require regular schedules blood work. I'll be honest, I did the irresponsible thing and ended up just not taking them. I got tired of taking medicine at that point; because, I had been taking it all my life. Whether it was for childhood epilepsy, ADHD, depression, and the last diagnosis cyclothymia. Was hospitalized twice before I got the cyclothymia diagnosis, and it was pretty bad at one point, and looking back.. I'm really lucky I didn't mess myself up by just stopping cold turkey. Work with your psychiatrist and maybe even work with a therapist if you can. Do all you can do to find the proper treatment, and YOU WILL BE OKAY. You are not",1

The future is what we want it to be and we can try our hardest to make it how we want too, but in reality, nobody can ultimately control the future anyway. Focus on today. It's the small things.",1
"A lot of people turn to drinking alcohol to escape from feeling shit, to feel better or feel like nothing matters, the first 2 maybe 3 drinks kind of gives us a 'who cares' attitude, but when we keep drinking, it does make us feel more vulnerable and fragile, making us emotionally worse, Ive done this many times. What do you like doing? what do you like spendin your time on? movies? tv? games? being creative? could be anything, what is yours?",1
"Hi, I'd like you to know that I read your post and I'm another real person out in this big world. I have not been in the same situation you are in right now, but I can see how painful that would be.

"You change, life changes. 10+ years since my diagnose (I'm still young by the way). Most likely much longer though. It doesn't getter better, you learn to cope with it, life goes on. It will always be there, the baseline depression. Sometimes it will pull you down in a deep hellhole.",1
"You help it. I've always told myself that when something is bad, either change it or deal with it. I mostly used it all my mother who is pretty fat and puts down other people for being fat. When something can't be changed, the problem is not that you must deal with it, but that you don't know how to. Focus your thoughts on how to better the situation, maybe take advantage of it even.",1
"People never notice, I've gotten really good at hiding it and compensating by being an asshole. Truth is the vast majority of people either don't care or don't even pick up on it in the first place. Well off to bed gotta put on the mask and go to work in the morning.",1

"Same thing happened to me. I used to work for my uncle as a dish washer in a banquet style setting. I didn't do this out of depression but I hate wasting food (a trait I acquired from my grandfather) and lots of food was always being thrown out so guess what I would do? I would eat that delicious food all the time. I gained some 80 or so lbs in about 5 years. Went from 130 to 205. I quit that job about 7 years ago and have since lost most of the weight. I am currently 125 and still trying to get rid of the gut. &amp;#x200B; Go to the gym, eat better, and please please please don't give up on yourself.",1

"Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! (is doing *weird* things with my formatting.)  It's your birthday. You can be any way you want.

Yes. Because when you take them and then suddenly stop it can be dangerous. So take them but if you do end up stopping- do it gradually so you dont go through horrible withdrawal feelings,0

"They probably already know that cutting yourself good. People who self harm probably hear that often including myself. As much as you know logically that cutting good, sometimes you help it if it means that tiny bit of relief. Try suggesting alternative methods instead and asking why they cut. Is it the pain or is it seeing blood? If pain, tightly holding cold ice can be an alternative. There is pain but no damage. If blood, instead of cutting, trying using a red marker to mark themself instead. Talk through everything step by step and find possible solutions or alternatives at each step.",1

"The Power of Now literally saved my soul. I over analyzed every fucking thing and it was making me so, so miserable. I read it in a really bad period, and for the first time in a long time I felt really good again for a couple of hours. When those couple of hours came and went and I started to feel crappy again - I read the book again. It's not a big book, took about an hour and a half to read. I carried it everywhere with me for the next few weeks and whenever I could feel myself getting low, I'd read it again when I had the chance. I found over time the low moods became less and less. I also deactivated all my social media accounts while I could get my head around it all. I started buying more books on mindfulness and regularly read them. Besides understanding the present moment, it also helped me figure out my issues. Like, the root cause of my issues. As soon as I started to accept and own my feelings and the reasons I was analysing everything, it lifted a massive weight. I'm not saying it's a fix for everyone, but it sure as hell is worth a try.",1
i personally dont. But i can understand it. I can understand it down to my core.,1
"I wanted to have a kid for selfish reasons, I wanted a reason to live and I wanted someone who understood me. I feel like no one in this world can understand me and therefore no one is willing to put up with me, if I had a kid I could raise them the way I was raised and they would have the same genetics as I so I feel like they would have a chance of understanding me. Also it's pretty much a guaranteed way of having a companion for 18 years, and if you play your cards right it's someone who will tend to you in your old age and sit with you as you die. All that being said you'll notice I used past tense wanted instead of want and that's because I got hit with several physical illnesses that make it near impossible for me to have a kid (or even take care of a kid) and even if I were miraculously cured tomorrow I wouldn't want to risk passing on these illnesses and causing someone to suffer as much as I have suffered.",1
I feel that it's hard to exist. It hurts. But I'm scared to kill my self. What if things get better? If I killed myself I wouldn't be there to enjoy the things in life that I wish for. what the fuck do I do?,1
Same. I just end up delaying it for hours while watching dumb shit on youtube until its too late.,1
Last new years was my first one alone. I looked outside the window and saw people hugging eachother and laughing. My heart dropped through my asshole.,1

I feel like this every day. Then something happens (like a stupid comment) and I am reminded that no one actually cares it's all a facade. I've even started paying people to care like going to the hair dresser to get a wash and cut even though I don't need one or going to the chiropractor even though it doesn't help but for 15 minutes it's almost like someone cares.,1

"It's the little things that get me, I suppose. Whether it's a happy evening spent with family or an exciting roadtrip, everything just has something off about it. I also have anxiety, so this may play a role as well, but nearly every situation I can think of is tarnished by this overwhelming feeling of something being wrong. You feel out of place all the time and disconnected, like you're missing out on something everyone else is getting. And for me, I have no idea what is wrong, since it's impossible to pinpoint what isn't there. Thus, since the emotional side of everything is numbed, this feels like a storybook somewhere I'm a useless side character that the hero will never meet or care about. I want to feel happy, I just... don't. This blankness is what's really killing me, because now I can't build relationships or imagine a future. I'm destined to live alone and with no purpose. If you want a better grasp of the perspective, imagine seeing everyone as perfectly fine whereas you, for whatever reason, are the most ugly and screwed-up person imaginable. I know (or think I know) that it's rubbish, but I can't help but believe the voices, you know?",1
"Yeah, I find social media really mentally unhealthy. I already have a bad habit of comparing myself to people, and social media just encourages people to do so.

"I think it's a matter of perspective. Bad things happen to everyone, but how you react makes a difference. I don't see the point of complaining. If I'm upset or feel like I've been dealt a bad hand, I look for a solution. In the past, I used to beat myself up over all my screw ups or when I felt I wasn't treated right. I realize now that everyone goes through the same type of things and you can't fight them. Adults have the same issues with heartbreak and money trouble as teens, the only difference is they think they're experienced. No one is experienced. Everything that happens to you is the first time that unique situation happened to your unique person. Your reaction is the only thing that changes how these events affect you. I know it's generalizing a bit, but if only good things happen to happy people, it's because those people tend to focus on the good things that happen to them and view the bad things that happen as an obstacle that they need to overcome. They don't wallow. Having confidence that you will overcome these negative events helps portray the happy personality.",1

I'm kind of the same. people didn't like me in highschool but I tried my best just to be around people who would talk to me. I craved some sort of companionship. I would be lying if I said I'm fine not having friends but truth is I hope everyday to find someone I can connect with. One of my biggest dreams is to meet someone who becomes a life-long friend.,1

"Well at least you still can hold on to that choice. Being terminally ill for the past 7 years (Im 42 now) the physical pain of a slow and horrible illness has led to my depression and desire to die. It is up to my wife though. And for her I live every day in hell. When you have even one person to keep you going, it can be enough. I am a lurker here and I read posts to give me perspective. Rarely can I physically reply. But what my experience being bound to a bed 24/7 has taught me is that once I made my peace with dying, I became indifferent to everything. For myself It's been tough to see people truly depressed to the point of wanting to die. I am very empathetic, but my depression is a symptom so its hard to understand. The one thing I do understand though is that the last thing you want to hear is Don't do it!!! Call this number... or other similar programmed/indoctrinated responses. So just know this... The world and life can be one big shitshow... So it helps to keep toilet paper handy. Let your friend be your toilet paper and be your friends toilet paper. It will be enough.  Lastly... Just remember that no matter how bad life feels (and is...) even I am artificially grateful for the fact that I have a far better life right now (suffering from *pain and bound to a bed), than 99.999999% of all humans to have ever lived. Just try to make it as long as you can. Know how much worse it can be. And let your toilet paper know that you need them to help clean up some shit. Then when you are ready to go.... You will know. But I cant see it happening for you as long as you remain attached to someone that you can call a friend. So give yourself a list of requirements that must be met for you to end it all. *- Pain so severe that causes me to vomit my own feces at times as it sends my body into shock. I wish you the best. I hope you can suffer less in time if possible. You and I are here right now... That makes us stronger than those who gave up yesterday. (And if you do one day come to the realization that you must go, make sure to do it in a way that allows your organs be given to help others. It helps me knowing that maybe I will have something that can give a healthy, long, and amazing life for a person who is still able to live it. ) Just think about making the list... And go tell your friend, right now, that you love him/her... Even if they are not quilted and only 1-ply thickness. You both need that right now... The whole world needs that right now.  Edit: sorry for the novella and my poor humor. Brain isnt what it used to be.",1
"What types of jobs are you applying for? I ask because every single job (since graduating college) I've ever had has been a job where the company required a degree, but the job itself didn't necessary need the skills provided by a degree. They used the degree as a way to weed people out. I have a BA as well, and student debt, but I don't feel like it wasn't worth anything. Even though I took a pay cut with my new job (for better benefits), my income is still more than the average income for a family where I live. I say this because, at this point, you can't change that you got a BA. You just gotta accept it and don't dwell on the I should have dones because if you do, you'll just fuck yourself over and the negativity will eat you alive. Now, you just gotta make a plan - what can you do with your degree? What are some skills you learned from your degree and previous jobs that can transfer over to something else? Is there anything at all you can cut from your budget? Get a roomie? Etc. Plans suck and when you're already depressed, the are the last things you want to be worried about, but it's hard to change things you don't like without one.

It takes conscious effort to recognize our speech patterns as poisonous and slowly change not cares, you the one suffering.

Whatever you do, don't beat yourself up, because I'm sure you're doing everything you reasonably can be right now. I hope tomorrow's okay. And don't hesitate to reply with an update later, yeah? You'll be okay &lt;3",1
I think you should try to get a therapist to open up about what you're going through. opening up to someone that you trust can also help you because bottling up your feelings will just worsen your emotional state,0
"Two things. First, instinct. I won't stop needing food, water, sex, etc. Something drives me towards those things even in my darkest moments. It's like my lizard brain wants to survive, but the more advanced brain wants to disappear. Lizard brain often wins. Second, recognizing we weren't meant to be happy. Nothing created us to receive a constant flood of feel good chemicals. The creator of this game called life is a sick, sick thing. When I can laugh at it, I'm better. When I welcome it, I'm unstoppable.",1
My favorite time of the day is definitely 11pm-3am,1
Thank you. This is the first time I have been able to really associate my exhaustion with watching television or movies. I also hate it when I have to feign interest watching things sometimes - it gets to where I feel physical pain from the effort of looking engaged.,1

"Same here, friend. What's your favourite Zeppelin song or album?",1
"If it for the promise of dying one day, I would feel no motivation to live. sure the fear of death keeps some folks awake at night, however, assuring myself that there is no escape from eventual death eases my insomnia fueled anxieties. So say no, living is not better than dying.",0
"Your are actually thinking about how unhappy you are, or about the feeling of sadness, it becomes like a fixed thought, and the brain can only think about one thing at a time, thats why you have problems processing other things",0
"Meditation helps to rewire the brain... it's how I've stayed med free with bipolar. Your brain starts to go for relaxation and calm instead of a default down feeling or thought. But you have to keep doing it over and over, even when it feels like it's not working. It's not for everyone though! Mindfulness is a way of moving through life slowly for Me, finding little bits of joy in the smallest things like making and drinking a drink. This is what got me out of bed in my darkest days...",1
You dont have to deal with stupid ppl.,0
Before depression I played a lot of video games and was happy. After depression I play a lot of video games and am unhappy.,1
Happy birthday. Strike up a conversation with a stranger. Great way to meet people in a new place.,0
"I have very bad social anxiety. It's the reason why I'm depressed actually. Every single day, even a simple interaction with someone can make me feel sad. I worry about stupid shit like did I say bye to a friend the right way. Stuff like that and just being a severely shy person is making me feel I won't be able to get anywhere in life. I'm nearly 16, so it might not seem like something I need to worry about. But it seems everyone else around me has everything sorted out. All my friends have partners, a job and are pretty confident in themselves. But with me having none of those things, I feel like the only place my life is going is living with my parents until I spiral into a deeper depression and probably take my life.",1
"Just don't let it bother you, in the grand scheme we're all going to die anyway so",0

"Something that you should try is walking. There is something so clarifying about it. It is great therapy (for me anyway). I recall all the times as a child walking with my father around the country roads just talking, or walking in solitude observing nature unfold around you. Don't even plan it. Just go and walk and walk. I let my mind wander outside of reality (into my fantasy world).",1
"Your boss and co-workers sound like fucking cock suckers, tell them to shove it.",1
"I did feel the same way as you, and some days I still do. Some things that I've done that seemed to work: Exercise, if Im exercising and going to the gym the consistency seems to flow to other parts of my life. Joining a club at uni, having friends keep me motivated in my studies. Also sort of having something to do outside of classes (I don't have a job). Make friends in your course, it helps to know you're not the only one in struggle town, and if you get stuck you can ask someone. Also think hard about why you're studying what you're studying, be in it for the right reasons. Keep in mind university isn't for everyone, and it isn't the only way to lead a fulfilling life. Also career changes are very common so since you're in your final year you can just stick it out and know that the future awaits. You're not locked into doing whatever your degree says you have to do. I think a lot of students are in the same boat, and good on you for making this post and trying to work out what you can do about it. Good luck!",1
Hey you can chat with me. I'm also feeling lonely..and nobody wants to talk to me also,1
"I used to do this a lot. Thinking of really aggressive and horrific things happening to me would make me feel so much better. But afraid thinking like that would just make suicide seem easier and easier. While here you might as well think or do something else you like. Anything at all, even if really shitty or just doing drugs all day or whatever! not here long anyway so you might as well do whatever makes you happy for the time being while we wait to expire.",1
"I don't want to be here either after 25+ years of this bullshit. 4 suicide attempts later though I've realised that nonsense. I'm here if I like it or not and you are too. The reason we're both still here is because something is keeping us here. You may not know what the fuck that is yet, 'cause I sure as fuck didn't, but with time you really will. It may be to keep watch over delicate friends. It may be to provide entertainment by being a funny motherfucker, it might be there because you're a genius that doesn't know how to communicate with the rest of us idiots. My point is, you're clearly an intelligent person that struggles with emotional bombardment, and treat it like that. Suicide isn't as easy as people say. It takes real guts and my 4 times were a cry for help. I know people that have gone the full way so FFS find something in you that you do actually like, fuck what other people think, and press forward my friend. You've got it in you.",1
"That's life... Look at it this way, if your at he bottom now, it only goes up from here right?",1
"I wish it was that simple, I went through the same thought process. Think of it this way, an easy suicide is going to take some set up, living is way easier. Plus once the depression clears you'll be glad you did.",1
"Same. It's 3:10 here. I'm probably gonna stay up until I have to go to class, then I'll eat lunch and go to sleep. Wake up and repeat. Or at least that's what I've been doing in the past few weeks.",1

you ever done opiates before?,0
"Not everyone is toxic. Perhaps you are hanging around the wrong people? Start out by ditching the toxic people in your life, and make an attempt to find new friends. There are various hiking groups that are good for that (hikers always seem like happy people). Volunteering is a great way to meet nice people as well.",0
"side effects were bad, but the withdrawal was worse than coming down from opiates. over a month later, having rebound headaches and dizziness. i would suggest never taking it!",1
Thats pretty awesome dude smiling is fun.,1
"I've never done it, but I've seen people do it, usually with 5 or 6 dogs, they have apps and websites for walking or pet sitting. It might take a month to build some clients, but the hours are flexible and you pretty much get to be your own boss, and pet dogs all day The main thing is to choose something you enjoy, it will feel much less soul killing, and will come naturally, rather than feeling like you're fighting to survive.",1
"Try not doing it to expect something in return. It feels really forced. I know you probably don't actually care, but pretend like you really do, with the mentality that you're doing this to make them feel better. It's gonna take some acting, but it has to be genuine.",0
You are never truly alone. There's always someone who cares about you,1
I wish I couldn't feel anything at all.,0
"kinda how I feel. actually scared to die, but hard to live. What keeps me going is that one day just sleep forever and whenever that day comes it keeps me at peace. I gotta go now. My time will come and I have to stress or worry.",1
Not stupid!!! Everyone gets that same feeling,0
"I swear, if people didn't have families, there would be a lot less depression in this world. I guess it really depends on the type of family stress. Can you realistically put some distance between yourself and the stress? Or is it something that you have to resolve?",1
Not a bad resolution though but add one more thing to it so not just about that one thing.,0
Vidya. And riding my bike. While contemplating my life.,1
"Heh. The thought of suicide is what I sometimes turn to at night to help me sleep. The thought of ending it all is just so strangely comforting, like nDad's grilled cheese sandwiches or my sisters voice. It's even calmed me down when I've been laying in bed, sobbing hysterically.",1

Sounds like what my parents would say to me.,1
what do you like doing?,0
"there. Usually just under a year and then I fall into another episode. been through 15 jobs in the past 10 years. Granted some of them were part time when I worked multiple jobs at once but still shows I hold down a job for long.

It's all about tiny victories!!! Keep going my friend :),1
"Staying at home: regret. Loneliness. Going out: pain, anxiety. Even more loneliness when being in a crowd and having nobody to talk to. I forced myself out again and again to _some_ social events that I can do and that also advance me. Where I actually can talk to people.",1
"Happy Birthday, you could try suggesting to your friends/family to play some board games or card games, if you aren't able to do anything with people then you could try mediating to some sounds of the ocean or watch some videos about baby foxes.",0

Only more recently. I went through a new and confusing situation and thinking about it now gets me angry because I can't change anything about it yet I still have the irrational feelings,1
"I think it's real, but not that all depressed people have it. I think I have both an irrational pessimistic bias and a rational pessimistic bias. My beliefs in pessimistic philosophies such as existential nihilism, the right to die, antinatalism, veganism, and disapproval of wild animal suffering are rationally justified. I believe that I'm correct that life is pointless, unnecessary, and more painful than pleasurable. I think that most people have an irrational optimism bias that makes them unaware of how awful the world really is.",1
"an enhancer of mood. The danger of drinking goes like this: Alcohol makes you numb. While also making your focus more on certain things. So, if you are angry and you drink, you might start to feel less angry. This because alcohol is making the problems go away, just becoming less conscious. The common thing that happens is we trick ourselves into thinking alcohol = less The reality is that there is less of anything. There is less pain, but there is less joy, jealousy, curiosity, on the spectrum of sobriety, stone sober is at one side and unconscious is on the other side. In other words, the more you drink, the close you move to passing out...which explains why you feel less the more you drink. This seems like not the worst thing in the word. But the problem lies in revisiting sobriety (which is why I call it an if The feelings return and feel stronger than before. This is often what promotes alcoholism. a perpetual escape from returning return of feeling. This is not to demonize alcohol. Like I said, all about how used. Since, underage, I recommend it. But when you do find yourself drinking one day, try to think about why your drinking. Whenever I have drank because I was sad or angry, I had a miserable time. Whenever I drank because I was around good company and wanted to relax a bit, it was fun. Responsibility is truly key to the concept of alcohol.",1
It's hard bud. I agree with GwenSkin.,1
One of these things will slowly kill you. Neither one will save you.,0
"I feel only bad things, too. I can laugh and joke with my buddies, but it just feels hollow and empty on the inside. I even come to think, that I often times smile and laugh, cause I know a normal person would do this and I did it once, so to don't look like a freak, I do it at the right times. But I'm never excited these days. I can't even remember the last time I was. Even when I decided to lose my virginity to a prostitute when I was around 30, I had some concerns but I wasn't excited. Birthdays and partys, I knew I couldn't wait for some when I was in my early twenties. Nowadays, I actually have to push myself to go out and meet friends, even though I absolutly KNOW it will be a nice evening. So, I understand what is up with you. Unfortunatly, I can't give you any advice. :(",1
Parts of you might be dying while other parts are being born.,0
"the same. Whenever having bad anxiety... almost nothing interest me. I want to play games, make music, watch tv, or anything. It sucks",1
"you are not, stay positive, look ahead",1
"That's hard. Especially if you're the type of person to post in this sub. Loving yourself is really difficult. But loving others is easier. And I do love you. When you love others, I find, its easier to love yourself. Even just saying the words and seeing it echoed back makes me feel good. I hope I helped.",1
"Some people might not want you to die. If you need help with suicide, I suggest you go to r/SuicideWatch  I'm in a bad situation right now but I'm not motivated to do anything, not even suicide.",1
I like to do healthy or productive hobbies when I feel like that. Sometimes it's all I look forward to in my day and it helps pull me through one day at a time. I think talking to others will help a lot too. If you wanna chat you can PM me.,1
Monster is a good word for it. No one understands. My counselor fired me. The guy on the phone for the national suicide hotline made fun of me. I'm on my own regarding this.,1
"I always think that to myself when I'm feeling suicidal. But there's always something that keeps me going and I just haven't figured it out yet. Maybe because in the end of all of this, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Last night I had an incredibly suicidal episode; I've hurt myself in the past as well. And while I don't know how you feel personally, I can relate. When I feel the way I do, it's really hard to try and see the world around me. Your mom just doesn't understand what you're going through and you need someone that can support you. Hell, even I'll do it and I don't even know you. Sorry if I am ranting, but I do just think that you need to find the right people that can help lift you up. My mother hasn't supported me in any of my depression and anxiety issues at all and it's the loneliest feeling in the world. That's why I turned to. So if you need support, you can talk to me. I don't judge. Ever.",1
Just wondering how your holding up?,0
"There is no point to life. We find our own meaning in life. It sucks, but that's it. I'm sorry. I wish I could give you better answers. I love you.",1
Me too. Me too. Not the only thing that makes me hate this awful society.,1
I think that drugs could make depression worse though.,0
It's the first new show in several years that seems interesting at all to me. Just when everyone was worrying about hbo,1
"You are on your own, which gives you the power to turn it around! You are not your mistakes, your past, your parents, your bully. You are a person doing the best they know how! You can ask for help, but it is up to you to accept it. Loving yourself is difficult and getting to that point is painful",1
"Please do whatever stuff that makes your feel your own worth. In your case, that's a good stuff. If you're in the path towards the positives, keep on walking. Good luck.",1
"I guess you just become a realist? An example, a family was diagnosed with diabetes and the doctors told her that if she waited for another hour before going to the doctor that she could have died. All the family was worried. But me? I just thought If she dies, well, it was her time. The things that happen to everyone else don't apply anymore to you. And it terrifies me.",1
"Sorry to hear that. Obviously a very painful experience. Of course you're not crazy for feeling like that makes you wonder about your value as a person, but to get through this life you'll really want to get to the place where you understand other people's behaviors are a reflection of them and not of you. I'm not trying to suggest some stupid mind-trick here, of course when someone chooses another person over you, you are going to have thoughts of worthlessness and insecurity. But even if someone you are with realizes they'd rather be with someone else, it doesn't require them to cheat on you, they could just be an adult and end a relationship before doing something behind someone's back. Human love is fickle. There's no way to ever say that anyone who decides to spend time with you owes it to you to honor that choice forever, but it certainly doesn't mean they have to cheat and lie. This advice has stuck with me ever since I heard it on a podcast; don't ever expect other human beings to be rational, or to assume they are playing by the same set of rules and understandings as you are. They lived so much of their lives before you were ever it in, you have no idea if this behavior could be a reflection of something somebody else did to them in their past or whatever. You can't blame yourself for other people. Otherwise a total stranger could walk up to you on the street and punch you, and you'll spend the next week wondering what you did wrong instead of identifying that person as a violent crazy person. Regardless, it isn't exactly the most logical part of your mind that is going to feel rotten about this for a while, so no amount of information is going to make it feel better right away. But try to love yourself, and work on coming around to that understanding that other people's choices do not say anything about you, only about them. This action means that they are a cheater, not that you are worthless.",1
"Sometimes it does feel like people suck, but with billions of them around, there's bound to be a *lot* of good ones.",0
"That it has stripped me of a personality. I used to like reading, going to the gym, animals, etc. Now I don't enjoy anything. I'm an empty shell, I don't like anything, I don't hate anything (except myself). I'm just... there. Like a piece of furniture.",1
"At the last minutes i kinda regret it, especially if i had to fall asleep while it's the dawn, i hate dawn. I have noticed that i sleep much better during the day, i even fall asleep easily during a day, even if i keep the normal mode of awake/sleeping.",1
It is even worse if you were lazy before you got depressed and now you are double lazy lol,0
"Please don't cut yourself. You can post more about your situation, I'm sure there are always people in this sub that will offer a listening ear. I would.",1
I can't decide if I would feel like crying a bunch after that or not,1
Yes. I also have anxiety issues so if I'm not fumbling my words because of that I'm struggling to follow my own thought process because of the fog. I'm sure I appear to be the most awkward/weird/air head around. Because of this I stay home most all of the time and don't socialize or anything.,1
In what way? I can relate to it in a sense that...I think that depression is actually natural? The world/society/most people etc. are shit so it kind of makes sense to not enjoy this gift of life? Pretending that everything is great feels like a delusion to me. Maybe being depressed means being realistic.,1
That's a pretty good summary of the last several years of my life. On an unrelated note: you like penguins? I like penguins.,1
Ya a few weeks ago my manager at work made a rude comment to me. She does this all the time and it wasn't even that big of a deal but I was depressed for like 3 days. I went home that night and legitimately wanted to die. Sometimes it's just the straw that broke the camels back yknow.,1
What do you like to do?,0
Could be worse. Hate is still an emotion.,0
Im always here for you,1
I can relate to this. The worst part for me is feeling as though I have no purpose or anything. I couldn't wait until school ended for the summer but now I feel worse because I'm not doing anything. I've taken to drinking during the day to keep the bad thoughts at bay.,1
It's like wanting to diet but also wanting pizza and ice cream.,0
No. only you can make yourself happy. Other people will only disappoint you.,0
"If she doesn't have or doesn't want to give a reason, trying to force it out of her isn't going to help anyone. Acknowledge that it is over and find a hobby or something to do with your time.",1
What did you write in your note?,0
"Jeez, take it to a computer shop and see if they can't salvage the hard drive, as long as the hard drives ok it's still there, and a word of advice, write everything in drive",0
"well i guess when you put it that way, nobody would be able to save you. puddles are pretty small, probably like your inner circle, so the more people you have around you, the more chances you have to meet people who care about you. depression may feel like being encapsulated, but nobody can help if you domt ask for it. idk im drunk",0
I'm feeling this way this morning. I almost wish I had work today so I'm keeping busy and keeping thoughts away. I'm so numb and empty .,1
Agreed. Feeling the same way.,1
I lost my coupon unfortunately. Ended up going to Subway,0
"We're 2 in this nightmare. I'm basically living in my head all the time, questioning whatever happens around me and feeling empty af. I'm also afraid of every situation I have to face that I'm not controlling. I feel so drained.",1
"I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety during my final year of university. I paused my studies initially to recover but am due to return in January. Now, I've actually decided to throw out that plan and transfer my remaining credits to an online university instead. I'm in contact but I haven't heard back so fingers crossed.",1
And then tossing it onto the floor while thinking that it still looks normal,0
"I'm 15, I'm not sure that I've been really happy since I was seven years old. I can hardly remember what it feels like anymore.",1
what in the past has made you happy? What do you know about your basic dispositions and functions as a human?,0
"it could be fatigue, it could be avoiding the anxiety/responsibility of dealing with others which is the case with me",1
What kind of things interest you?,0
"I used to feel like that, pretty sure I have a post from a few months almost exactly the same. But it does get better friend. You can overcome those feelings, it takes effort but it is possible. Hope you get better soon",1
Lucky you...I just wanted the same but all my family is spending it with each other and their in laws...I wasn't invited anywhere with any of them and yes I know this sounds like a pity party.,1
Don't view that answer as something that is permanent. She has her reasons to be convinced an if I were you I would write down the reasons you want them for an have her read it an think about it to at least reach the same page an maybe she can give you some tips or reach out for some other type of help.,0
What do people know it's easy for someone to judge without knowing all the facts wish people would think before they speak.,0
"thats great! doing things, even simple ones, like making your bed, can really help.",1
You're both going through a lot right now. I think you owe it to yourself and your husband to sit him down and have a serious talk about how both of you are feeling. You say your lost. The best thing to do when one is lost is to get your bearings; that's what I think you should do with your husband.,1
"Well, that was a nice idea of your stepmom's. I'm sorry it didn't help--I've read that massage helps people recovering from EDs with body image, but maybe it takes a couple sessions. Hang in there.",1
I feel you man hope things get more positive for you. Sending good vibes.,1
"always on my own. be happy for a while and then I get hit by a random mood swing and suddenly I hate myself, I be here, I want to go home. It drove a lot of my friends away",1
"Wood or aluminum? Or I guess, better first question, sports equipment or animal?",0
Sorry to hear you're feeling this way Can you see a doctor or a psychiatrist? They can help you get anti depressant medication. They will also probably tell you to make an appointment with a therapist and to see a therapist regularly. Hope this helps,1
"I know what you mean. When I was suicidal the pain I would cause my family was sometimes the only thing that held me back. I tried to think of them as living proof that Depression (personified for metaphor) was wrong about me. It told me nobody cares, nothing matters, if you died nothing would change. I showed it my mother and sister, and told it even if you see no value in me, others do. Basically, in my mind, I used my family as a logical check against the lies. Depression knows it is irrational; like a con man, it relies on persuasion rather than facts. But even when it takes over all of your other emotions, it can't take control of the emotions of others.",1
Good for you! I hope that your day gets even better! :),1
In my twenties and still buy toys to put on a shelf if that counts.,1
Try finding new hobbies. This will help your mental state stay focused on something else. Also just try going out and engaging with other people. This always helps me since social interaction is really good for mental health.,1
"Oh shit man please fucking don't. Firstly death by acid is more painful than having your DNA ripped apart by radiation. Secondly, explain your life situation to me and we can talk, I'm here for you",1
"This is a normal feeling. I've felt this. I don't have much constructive to say except that it is something that is completely okay to feel, and the feeling will fade as you feel better more often.",1
I feel this way everyday. Its hard.,1
"*sigh* Fine, give me your address. But you have to shoot me after I do you, ok?",0
me too i dont care about studying or getting a job all i want to do is just ride my bike all day and play basketball. i hate being home and criticized or judged for being slim and other stupid bullshit,1
"I feel you bro, i had to give up my favourite career because of arthritis in my knee from my dream sport, now i have to go to uni and deal with my alcoholic mum and my own issues for 5 months till i can finally move out",1
if this isn't a mood...,0
"Yep. In conversations with my therapist, we have discussed me having some kind of attachment disorder around this. I am constantly seeking and craving connection with others. I can be at an airport and be thinking about connecting with other people. We traced it to childhood stuff (no surprise there) of abandonment and alienation, unmet emotional needs. Then when and if I do connect, my expectations are pretty high since I am willing to do whatever to reach out to the other person and increase the connection. When that is not reciprocated to the expectations that I have (because they are not trying to fill the massive hole that I am), I feel rejected and then shut down. I internalize this sense as a rejection of me as a person (they don't like me, I'm not worth liking, they got to know and discovered i'm no good). Rinse. Repeat. That's my pattern at least. Knowing the pattern helps, but it doesn't mean I can always identify it and stop it. Thanks for letting me share.",1
That's a very poetic reminder. I will be scripting it in my journal. Strength and peace as you hold on.,1
"You should, but in this society you don't.",0
"Wait, you got fired due your depression? Where are you from? Isn't depression classified as a medical condition like any other? Aren't you protected by law against such action? Sorry to read about your situation. And sorry for all the questions. Guilty of being a lawyer :/",1
"Moral of the story is actually you have shitty friends. Or, a slim possibility, they may not know how to help you cope so they don't try bc they don't wanna make it worse. (I've done that before unintentionally. Terrible idea and i felt like complete shit for it.)",1
"I know how frustrating this is. My dr diagnosed me with a really difficult to treat depression. once a medicine starts working I immediately i start feeling more awful than ever. I'm trying to get my life together. I got a kitten to keep me company and after months of job searching I got hired at a cool place (I start in a week). But i'm having worse nightmares than ever, and I just can't be as excited as i think I should be. Its hard :(",1
"What do you think death will be like, if I might ask?",0
I've done that before. Depression is an illness that needs to be treated holistically. It's hard to do (heal) when you're working.,1

You aren't a bother. :),1

I hope you can make it further on in life, as how I have a goal to live normally in life and try to take it step by step, but it those steps can hurt sometimes.",1
"Yep, the only thing holding me back from suicide.",1
"Before you wish for others to understand, you must be able to understand it well yourself, be able to explain it to yourself, only then can others help you.",0
"Well, good news is you got her number. It gets easier as you repeatedly do it. Sorry she reply :/",1
i feel very much like you. id like to give you advice but im just as broken so ill just let you know that i feel with you here. maybe that will help.,1
"On good days, I start off strong but that little burst of energy last long enough to get much cleaning done.",1
Is it possible to take your meds before bed,0
"I think once out of this, look back thinking I could never be happy? And enjoy those times when they last.",0
"I'm feeling that way now. And this is just me, I actually don't recommend it for others, but we're sharing, so for me I am literally laying in my bed right now, watching rubbish on TV and disconnecting myself from the entire world because it's the only way I'll make it through the night.",1
write me. write me about whats bothering you. sometimes putting all his worries in order is the best relief to start with,1
"I'm sorry you feel like this. My daughter has tried to kill herself 3 times and I pretty much have been mentally preparing myself for the worst for the last 6 months bc she was so so depressed and non responsive to meds, therapy etc. Then the craziest thing happened...she got involved in an old hobby, met new people she had stuff in common with, and just 5 minutes ago told me that she is going out to lunch with someone from that group. My point is...things can change. I hope things can change for you soon.",1
Same :) But like 50/50 chance caffeine will make me awake and motivated or panicked and anxious,1
"Heres a wake up call, were all going to die, its our only garentee in life.",0
happy birthday!!! glad still here,1
glad you found something to help even if just a little,1
"I don't, but sometimes i put my arms around myself in bed to feel like im getting a hug from someone",1
"I cant and i feel like a failure because of it. It has been extrodinarily hard for me to hold a job, and I became homeless long term because of it. I still cant function like a normal, productive citizen despite going back to work numerous times. Its even harder when the peoppe around you judge. Im 31 now and most of my peers have their own houses by now. Its so agonizing for me even though i am happy for them. Ill keep trying to get myself back though. Im sorry youre going through this OP.",1
Sorry mate but I don't think there's a way,0
"I remember reading or hearing this and it helped me with my body dysmorphism. It said: Fat cant be a feeling because fat is an actual thing. Its just triglycerides and fatty acids in cells in your subcutaneous tissue. What you see when you look at yourself in the mirror is millions of tiny cells holding you together so you can go out and be the best you can be. So be mad at all those tiny cells that are holding you together, keeping you warm, and nourishing you. incharge of your thoughts and actions so tell your brain to shut up and tell yourself beautiful, if you want to lose weight you can and will do it the healthy way, and if you want to lose weight then perfect the way you are. I hope you have a better rest of the day!",1
What makes you happy now? Or at least what distracts you from how much you hate yourself? (Sometimes that's as close to happiness as I can get),0
"Exactly, every time something good happens life finds a way to ruin it. You help but think course this had to happen, I just have one good thing happen to me without something going",1
Do something to take care of yourself please. Just something. One thing.,1
"Think of someone that you look up to (Actor, musician, famous person) and act like them.",0
"I have worried about that a lot. I inherited my depression from my mom. She could be pretty fucking terrible but the things that made her terrible had nothing to do with depression. I wish she had never had me, but aside from that, I just wish she had done more self care. She spent every waking hour at work or driving us to some activity. I wish she had instead slept and meditated and exercised for herself and stuff.",1
Define obsessed what do you think about?,0
That would not be normal for me but in my condition I would welcome such an arrangement whole heartedly.,1
Try the doctor for meds. A lot of therapists cannot prescribe meds. See if the doctor can give you a referral to a good psychiatrist or psychologist. A psychiatrist is an M.D. that specializes in mental illness. I hope this helps.,0
"I count. I really try hard to visualize the number in some fancy cursive or an intricate design, I count for as long as I need to to distract myself from the intrusive thoughts. I also bought a fidget toy that has several clicking buttons so I will also click those as I count.",1
"Was that supposed to be funny, because that was pretty funny.",0
Most problems are relative and we're able to express the same amount of pain. There's plenty of reasons to be depressed about; and equally there's a same amount to be happy about.,0
"I'm sort of the same. I have friends, but I don't have close friends. I can be at a social event, especially family gatherings and I would feel so alone when everyone has fun socializing with each other.",1
"guess it depends on what you want :( if you had it, it's like warm sunshine (you just feel really warm and comfortable and safe in the hug -- even if you both are standing outside in freezing winter weather) and then when you lose it you have been dumped in the freaking artic and you are constantly shivering and cold and just wishing that the person can come back and give you another hug even if he doesn't care anymore. feels like the little joy in your life has been extinguished and you have been ordered to return to your robotic, logical, depressing existence if you never had it, everything is very static and numb and getting through life is just a daily chore that you have to complete or else",0
"Definitely a part of it. I can sleep 8 hours and still some days I am just draggy, tired and unmotivated although other days just unmotivated.",1
"I used to think like this. Though, I fear I would cause others to get hurt because of my incompetence....",1
"If you believe life has little to offer, you're forgetting that you're alive. The fact that you were able to type this post was nothing short of a miracle in itself.",0
how deep does the rabbit hole go?,0
"That's really hard! I would encourage you in whatever efforts you take, to focus on compassionate presence, rather than simply solving a problem. Your present company, your listening ear, your genuine love for her is likely to be more helpful than if she starts to feel like she's just a problem that you're trying to solve. Beyond that, sometimes we need a little push to get counseling, or just eat a bit better, or get outside. Those things don't usually solve the problem in isolation, but they can help build her positive momentum. You can't be her savior, but you can help build a ramp towards something.",1
"All capps does not help , what kinds of shit do you like.?",0
"I believe life itself is meaningless but we create meaning within it, find something you like doing (doesn't matter if it's juvenile or whatever, fuck those who say otherwise) and get good at it. You just need one brick to start laying a foundation of self worth. Don't give up dude.",1
"Yup. I have since ceased trying to open up to people. I jam all of my feelings down deep inside and when they start to simmer over, I drink. In a sick way, I think this is a lot better than constantly being dismissed, rejected, invalidated and outright abandoned by other humans.",1
"This sounds so hard to deal with. You will get there and you child/children will give you strength. Mine has, I live for her. Sending love",1
Quit your job make some coffee and jump in a raid. Don't get out of your pjs,0
We are here if you need to talk to someone,1
"i feel that at times. it sucks because the person i want to love me does love me, just not how i want which is selfish of me. you can't depend on others for happiness though. love is great but you lost it and you're fucked. also it's hard to love or be loved if you don't love yourself.",1
"Yes, I was like this for over a year. A few weeks after starting Zoloft, I sat down for breakfast, and actually tasted my food. I cried a little.",1
"Then find something that you can put your all into and work on it. You need a distraction that doubles as a skill. Work towards that thing and put whatever you create on the internet. NaNoWriMo is going on, could take a crack at writing a book (every first book isn't good, don't worry, just have fun).",0
This. Doubly so the first part. Should be in bold letters on this sub.,0
We're like puppets just being strung along IMO. I'll feel relief when it's all over for me,1
Wonder how often that happens when people are blurry eyed typing into their smartphones...,0
"The more it manifests itself the more it'll take over your mind and convince you that it's a completely logical choice. I'm a fan of therapy, considering that you can find a good therapist. Talking to someone who doesn't degrade you for how you feel can be incredibly helpful. Those people tend to be hard to find in daily life.",1
"I've been there. Terrified of being labeled, getting locked up or my child taken away. Losing my job, as the sole breadwinner that's the last thing I need to have happen.Truth be told, I should have done it much sooner rather than trying to stick it out for 2 years. You wont regret it.",1
"I honestly don't care about school anymore, I just wanna be 20 and see if I can get a job and a place so I don't worry my family and maybe tackle depression without them knowing.",1
"yea I feel ya, I often end up redirecting the feeling out as anger instead, so I get like that then immediately get very angry and want to hit something. (anger directed at myself for being such a piece of shit usually)",1
I know how you feel but you have to remind yourself that even if right now no one would be worse off without you it doesn't stop you from making a positive impact in the world in the future,1
Try CBT. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. Find a therapist who uses this method. I've just started this so I can't personally verify that it will work but it has worked for others.,1
"If you physically can't afford it then there's not really much i can say. This isn't something i have experience with, medication is relatively 'cheap' in the uk. You might want to ask the question again on a medical forum, perhaps someone there may be able to offer some more useful advice. If you want to talk you're welcome to speak to me, but there's not much i can offer to alleviate symptoms.",1
"Well been a shitty day, as always.",1
I try to focus on my breathing until I can get to the bathroom or somewhere else semi private. Square breathing usually works best for me at least,1
I feel this way too. It doesn't help that our world is owned and run by lying sociopaths.,1
You feel judged? Perhaps you haven't accomplish what you told them you would? Or why do you feel this way,0
Hey two bad thoughs make a right! Or is it two lefts make a right,0
"It happens. It used to happen a lot for me in my final year of uni. Best thing for me was to call someone and they'd talk me down. It's not easy to study when you're crying, shaking and hyperventilating :/",1
Soil helps flowers bloom. You're beautiful!,1
I'm in the same boat. Except that now I actually live closer to him but it would be too weird to just start talking out of nowhere after so much time. I'm just waiting for the day I'll accidentally bump into him somewhere and hope he remembers me at all.,1
It happens to me every day.My doctor just thinks my body is too sensitive and reacts to my emotions.,1
Weed seems to help my anxiety which helps my depression overall,1
"Please don't. Im not going to sit here and preach how things get better and all that bs. But please just dont. Think about everything, every little thing that gives a small spark of joy to you. For example I can be at my lowest but a walk alone in a forest can make me feel calm and content, or my guinea pig brings absolute joy to me. You may believe theres nothing but theres always something. And if you truly believe theres nothing, change that. Change your life for the better, strive for your happiness that you deserve. Talk to someone or go for a walk. Just please do not end your life.",1
"Honestly would just set five minute goals, do something else, then go back to whatever task I needed to complete for five minutes. It also helped me to stimulate my brain in several ways at once, ie walking and reading or eating and studying. I got less distracted that way.",1
"Me too, that's why I treat everyone like shit. I'm hoping that one day nobody cares about me, even my parents. That day is the day I'll become free from my despair",1
same with me. im already dead from inside. i've stopped giving a fuck about all those false hopes.,1
"I am glad you aren't doing it, I am lucky myself in that I was equally lazy and depressed when I was at my worst, but by doing nothing you aren't making a terrible mistake. Thanks foring with us tonight.",1

"Or someone who gets anxious like everyone else, and doesn't have actual chronic anxiety.",0
Happy birthday. I hope you do something fun after work.,1
Do you want to share what happened?,0
I don't wanna get up at all either but I have a stupid appointment to go to.,1
I've been that way since a toddler. Never wanted to go outside if it was sunny--only at night or on cloudy days. Still avoid sunlight to an unhealthy degree haha. My folks joke about how pale I am :} I'm seeing now that sunlight avoidance seems to be a common thread w/ depressed folks... at least in this sub. Odd since light therapy is a proven treatment for improving mood. I get horribly depressed every Spring so I feel like my brain is wired backward.,1
"There is nothing more rewarding than seeing actual results! Congratulations on having a clean bedroom and bathroom. Don't forget that cleaning it the first time after a period of neglect is always the most work. If you continue to keep those places tidy, it will be much easier and quicker the second time around.",1
Same. Staying busy is the only thing that stands between me and my bad thoughts and it's really hard to stay busy every second of the day.....,1
I've always wanted to be a pelican,1
It seemed like you're upset because the only dinner options are meat?,0
Do you care about excitement at all or no?,0
"Definitely a daily struggle, but it seems like every day there's less and less reason to drag on.",1
a precious entity. so much more than the harm you cause yourself.,1
Cover up the pain temporary with Alcohol.,0
"Hi there. No one on this earth is worthless, even if you feel that way now. It gets better, things change, you will change. I browsed through your post history and noticed how young you are. The age you're in is a horrible hormonic stage. My son had the same feelings at that age-range. I did too. Even if life feels overwhelming and lonely now, this will pass eventually. Be patient. I have to go for a while, but will get back to you with how my son learned to cope. Hang in there. A big motherly hug to you!",1
"Maybe you can find a room mate or something ? Idk what type of housing you live in (e.g. apt., house, renting, etc.) but that may help cut monthly expenses in some way too if that's something you're looking for. Maybe get a pet if your housing accommodations allow it. Pets really help with loneliness and depression sometimes. People can even actually get their pets registered as official emotional assistance animals. In some cases, they will be allowed to live in certain housing areas in which pets would otherwise not be allowed. Sometimes it's easy to focus on the negative of living alone. But there are tons of good things about it as well. You just gotta look towards those as well.",1
"Everything counts, I didn't go to that extreme but I did go a whole month. Take cold showers btw that's said to improve your mood.",1
There's a lot of games I need to play this year. Literally nothing else.,1
Holy shit I can relate so well to this.,1
What would you do all day at home?,0
"Hey, I know how frustrating it feels when you have no one to reach out to.I am here for you if you want to talk, friend.",1
every time i hear someone died always so jealous!,1
"Why post this rubbish? Are you depressed? Do you think this trite advise means anything to those who are? Enjoy life, even if you don't enjoy it! makes perfect sense.",0
I don't want to die. I would be pissed if I died. But I sure as hell don't want to keep on living either...,1
I got a cat. She is the reason I'm alive right now.,1
"Well if it feels like another long stage depression, it's easier to get help now before it hits full force. Good luck and I'm sorry",1
Well stop being that way jeez,0
"I mean, if you want to get technical, you're still alone in death. What's getting you down?",0
"I think I probably spend too much time thinking about sex and stuff and it would probably be better if I didn't. Though I don't think I could enjoy it due to the ever present risk of STI's and unwanted pregnancies and even vasectomies don't technically 100% alleviate that risk. I don't think it would be really all as great as it gets built up in my mind to be. I think the biggest thing is the difficulty building up and sustaining interest in things to distract myself with. I have things I like, at least theoretically, but I never feel much like persuing them. It all seems kind of meaningless and stupid and pointless. I'm not sure how to get over that hurdle.",1
I know how you feel.,1
"Man I just turned 17 yesterday and I dont think ive had a real life friend since highschool started, so basically I dont think i'll be very helpful but i'd still like to respond. I also dropped out a few weeks ago which I do regret but I just couldnt keep up with the new school I transfered to. The thing that has been helping me lately, and what my pyschiatrist told me, was to get a hobby. I like to read a lot of japanese books so I picked up on the language so I could start reading them directly from Japan. It's not much of a hobby, reading books and learning a new language, but it gives me something to live for. I want to read a thousand new stories because I love many of the ones I have already read. I do however think friends are important, although I have none in real life. If anyone at all tries to be your friend, I think you should try and be more open to making friends instead of like me. The last person that tried being friends with me I pushed away a lot and faked most of our friendship, but I regret that since he was willing to put in the effort so I think he deserves to have a good friendship. Don't be fake, people will like you for who you are.",1
Feel free to message me if you'd like. One of the reasons I joined was to find friends to help battle my anxiety and depression.,1
"Hello there, don't worry, you're not alone! It's good you are reaching out in a state of confusion, it's better in a way that it can help you get a grip of things again. Just know you're not alone for now and that I'd like to lend an ear if you feel comfortable to. We're in this together.",1
"Hey man same here, I consider myself a loner too. never been in a relationship personally, if anything, they slow you down. If anything your friends are just showboating and most of their relationships will turn to shit regardless in later time.",1
I can 100% relate to this.,1
"doctor who, esp this quote. life is a pile of good things and a pile of bad things. the good things don't necessarily soften the bad things, but vice versa, the bad things don't always spoil the good things or make them unimportant.",0
"It works pretty well for me! The second week I had a bit of nausea, but that passed by the 4th week. It started to work for me around week 3 and although i still get episodes, I'd say it works really well. Missing a dose doesnt seem to have much effect unlike effexor where you really feel it. I'm currently on 10mg and cant say I have complaints. My docter is trying me on 15mg because my symptoms have been acting up a bit more than they should. (I've been on 10mg for a year now)",1
"Another holiday alone, not looking forward to this stupid holiday. New year, life is still shit. I stand seeing all the cheerful people when completely miserable. I stand the fucking music or the stupid forced family small talk. The holidays remind of how alone I really fucking am.",1
I know i'm kinda excited because this next year i've got this and /r/wholesomememes,1
"I know your pain. I've been there. I considered suicide just last week. I want you to check out a book: feeling good by Dr. David D. Burns. Just start it. If you're not too drunk, I'd be willing to chat for a bit",1
"Yeah, maybe they are trying to make you feel good. If you have people saying you're cute, though, then that's a big deal! Even if they're doing it for other reasons, you're a lot more cute and attractive than me (based on this being a complaint rather than being flattered)",1
Do I really need to link Jordan B. Peterson?,0
ye i thought so too. except im sitting alone crying and they're out doing normal-people stuff and having fun.,1
"I saw your post several hours ago and I've been thinking all afternoon about what you asked. I'm not sure if I can fully explain the shift I made from being depressed and suicidal to the generally happy person I am now. There was a whole series of decisions and lessons and realizations I've made over a period of several years which probably merits its own post (or series of them). I joined this a short time ago and have been sort of lurking, trying to understand this community and seeing if I have anything to contribute, and your post makes me realize that maybe just telling my story will help others make their own way on their journey. To answer your specific question, the one thing I have come to understand is that there really isn't going to be a time when you are entirely done with it. There will always be a chance, however small, that you can fall back into it. However the longer you go without falling back in, the easier it gets. I tend to think of it in terms of black holes and orbital bodies. I'm going to have to create a post on that. The truths I've found is that recovery and freedom from depression is about breaking habitual negative lines of thought by replacing it with more positive ones. It's about learning how to recognize when you are falling back into the pit of depression, and being able to pull yourself back out. It's about accepting and finding value in yourself, and finding many many reasons to continue to be alive, to contribute and interact with the rest of the world. Coming from the other side, I understand so many things that I used to see as negative really don't have any sort of positive or negative connotation. That was all in my head. Often those negative connotations were put there by others, sometimes inadvertently, sometimes deliberately. I had to learn how to strip those ideas off and choose a new set of ideas to assign. I learned how to identify what kind of ideas were worth keeping and using, and which ones were not and discard them. I know this doesn't really explain much how I see things now, and how I no longer feel depressed all the time, but I promise to share my story in the hopes of helping you understand how I got where I am, and maybe help you make a similar journey.",1
Sorry I ate them all lol,0
"Tell him to get some professional help, do your best to offer support but regardless of your relationship with them it is not your job to heal them. They can only do that for themselves, and that's something he will have to choose for himself. Start making appointments with well rated professionals now, it often takes time to schedule them. Good luck to you and your friend.",1
You're not alone. I feel the same way.,1
What's the message. I am curious,0
Don't be tunnel-visioned my friend. Currently you're seeing only the face of your love. But when you finally get out of the tunnel you'll find someone who was meant for you all along. Let him/her go. We're only humans.,0
"Sometimes I find treating it like that can help, though sometimes obviously I am just very clean and unhappy, with wrinkly fingertips. I wish there was better advice I could give but it's the old don't think about X problem. I hope you shake them off soon.",1
"I'm in the same exact boat that you're in. I also feel like my life is just a cycle. I get a bunch of schoolwork, I try to plan out the assignments, I get depressed because I'm overwhelmed by the amount of work and end up procrastinating, I finally decide to do the work but there's already not enough time to finish it, then I get spiral into self-loathing and depression again because I could have done better. It really builds up my stress in school and takes away from the sleep I need to get through the next day.",1
That's cool. Legos are awesome.,1
I assure you that you are not as ugly as you think. Have you heard of Body Dysmorphia? Its a condition in which people see themselves in ways that are very false and often they believe they are hideous.,1
"I lost mine years ago. I can only offer that you aren't alone, for what that's worth.",1
I don't really have anything to say besides that I understand your pain. Stay strong.,1

What a crappy thing that guy did! No--you're not the bad guy.,1
"You will find some people who will refuse to leave your side, regardless of what you're going through and regardless of if you both have disagreements or fights. It might take a while, it took me several years, but just keep searching. Be yourself, and the right people will come and they will love you for you. It might take a while, but don't give up hope.",1
"I wish I could just not go to work and sleep all day. Shit, I'd just be happy to be able to sleep at all.",1
Yeah i feel ya its kinda like a part of a song that i once wrote every single night in my dreams i die waking up dissapointed im still alive,1
What makes you say these things?,0
"I thought so until I came to realized that your health department is seriously lacking. Getting a pension would be really nice, if you have that in your country, but it's usually quite low. But beside that, the health is too damn hard. Of course you got 70 years old being president or running marathon and all. But I've seen people around me and it's just a blend of being tired, in pain, and or being slow, clumsy, close to handicap doing basic things. It scares me, especially with all the diseases that my relatives have or had, and the fact that I don't take care of my body as well as I could/should... Sorry if this is triggering anything in anyone, or a bit despairing. One upside is that science is doing wonders, so in your life time you could survive more shit, being treated better, and I believe our generation is going to react to the way we take care of the elderly in general. DO NOT LOSE HOPE... but the grass is always greener...",1
"You can always speak to a doctor. They can assess you using diagnostic tools, like tests, and observation.",0
I had a therapist for a few months. It was nice to have someone who legally can't tell anyone anything you tell them.,1
"This actually sounds like me yesterday but with my boyfriend. Ended up talking to him and seeing how much he loves me despite all this really made me feel loved. Just like how my bf is, I believe your gf loves you for who you are. sell yourself short! The fact that you are trudging throng life despite fighting depression shows how strong of a person you are mentally~",1
I went in 2015. It saved my life. It was one of the best experiences I had to get better. I help it works out for you. I was facing hell back then. The only thing I didn't like was the therapists and people running the program always reminded us we had mental illness and mentioned mental illness constantly. It was fucked up. Other than that it helped a lot.,1
None of that fucking works. Anyone who thinks it does doesn't understand depression or what anyone here is going through. The only time it works is if it is a genuine expression of love and care from someone important to you. Not this generic bullshit that you get fed every other day,1
"Oh boy, I was also upset. I was about 15 and felt like such a loser. Now I'm so glad I got help at a young age.",1
Distilled water.if you injest enough will cause your red blood cells to explode.If you have IV this can be accomplished much quicker.,0
Appreciate that you have someone to love I guess I don't know the situation. Sorry you feel that way. Guys like me will never have anyone to love though so yay at least you aren't me,1
"making friends is the hardest and easiest thing ever depending on if you find the right person. the easiest answer is just do it, go up to someone or send them a message. Worst case: it's awkward. Best case: you'll get a friend",0
"in a similar situation, honestly. It sucks.",1
"Rather than seeing an entire population, you are seeing a narrowed down group based upon one specific topic. It may seem hat there are a lot of relationship and family conflicts posted about here because those are large factors in depression. There is no one cause to depression. It stems from a multitude of factors both biological and environmental. Past and present experiences, genetics, predesposed vulnerabilities, social connections, all play a role.",0
Man she don't know what she's saying then! I had/still kinda have it. There are different levels so I don't know where about's you are but it only gets better if you let it. Try going into a senses deprivation tank if you have one in your town. Trust me. Meditate. Look at yourself and why you think this is. You'll figure it out :),1
"I don't know how to help, but I'd just like to say that you're not alone in your depression. I haven't gotten to where you are yet, but I do understand your pain.",1

"Talk with your teachers, ask how you can get caught up and back in the swing of things. Most teachers would be happy to have you reach out, plus by being in communication with them, they'll be there to help keep your motivation up. Work out a plan for each class on how to raise grades, maybe see if you can stay before or after school with one of them to have them monitor you while you work. I hate to say this, but school academics come over sports. If time mangement is becoming hard, maybe ask if you can lower yourself from captian position. Freshmen year is easiest for most, so you might want to get help now to save yourself from only deciding to change say in junior year. I'm sorry your mental illness is having an affect like this, but the first step is admitting you want help which you've done so good job! I'll be rooting for you.",1

Yeah I have gone numb to life while sober and spend my high regretting getting high. When that happens I get even higher to drown out life,1
You are more equipped to deal with it :) Youre like a marathon runner thats been a couch potato for the past ten years because you didnt have a reason to run... How are you feeling ?,1
"Often times people take laughter as a cue that what doing is okay. I do the same thing whenever someone picks on me, even though it hurts inside for all of us. let other opinions influence how you see yourself, as hard as that can be. &lt;3",1
I'm sorry that haopened. I've never had a breakup because I always get rejected. I've had similar things so I can at least get an idea of how that must feel. But I believe you can find another girl you live.,1
Your foundation needs to fall down before you can start rebuilding. Have you started the plans the blueprint? List everything on a paper or make a note in your head what you need to do to make things better. I'm still rebuilding right now. But I don't have this dark ugly building that overshadowed me. Now I can start thinking what the fuck I need to do in order for my new building to be beautiful the way I want it. It'll take time but it's all worth it. Allow yourself to rebuild.,0
The 211 people online right now care. That's a fact. We're all here for one another.,1
"It's a terrible feeling when you try to hold on to even the most minuscule things that bring you any slight amount of joy, and one by one those things get taken from you. What I try to do is work back on a route to the thing that would lead to getting the one thing that could be right. i.e. something that costs money makes you happy, but you don't make enough money; need a way to make more money; dedicate all free time to applying for better work. Or, feel lonely and haven't got anybody; need to find somebody to stop feeling like that; need to know best places to find somebody; research ways to meet people and put self into that situation. Or feel worthless; being of use to someone or something would make me feel less worthless; dedicate myself to making myself of use to someone who needs somebody; use free time aiding charity or institution where people need you, and you can feel needed. Honestly, I know it's not that easy a fix, and there will be more bumps to overcome. One of my larger problems is isolation and loneliness, and even having looked at places to go, I still haven't found the courage to put myself into a situation to meet people. But generating a simple starting point where you can do something easily achievable, even just through reading online about how to get started, can make you feel proactive and start to get you into a more productive feeling that maybe it won't be like that forever, and that there is a physical, tangible, mortal way to deal with the situation. So, I would recommend pick a small goal that CAN lead to some form of happiness and work towards that, rather than try to envision this great milestone of achieving happiness in one big leap. Helps you take it day by day a little easier, and I hope that would make each new day, if not better, at least consistent for you. Feel better soon, bud.",1
"Yes, I sometimes have that type of pain. Ibuprofen definitely doesn't help. I don't know of anything that does.",1
"this will probably not help you but i had a very long depression i was unable to do the most simple tasks, sleeping in my own trash, i lacked the energy to clean my god damn place how much more useless could i become? Sounds funny but its true, hurting my self, crying to sleep, no friends and honestly looking back i was a complete waste of space better off to have my brains blown the fuck out. But that doesnt mean we dont have the potential to completely change things around. This was me 2 years ago for a solid decade i was barely hanging on and now ive changed everything around and i do not suffer from daily suicidal thoughts, self harm and long depressing episodes.",1
"I watched a short video once (I'm sure can google but I'm on phone and about to get in car) that compared depression to a big black dog. On bad days the dog is giant and weighing you down and on better days the dog is small and at your feet. This helped me accept a lot more about my life and my depression rather than constantly wishing it could just go away. I would get so mad at myself for being angry/sad but now I know it's like owning an animal--you take care of it and it won't bite you, at least not as much anyway. It's part of who you are and that is okay. I do not have severe depression so I am not on meds, so can't speak for those folks who are, but for me exercise and doing things for me (rather than constantly for others or other people's approval) really helped. It's like learning to be selfish in a good way. Eating less carbs and gluten helped too as they tended to make my body more sluggish which did t help when I already felt sad/slow/tired. I eat a lot more protein and fresh veggies now and I think there is a big difference--especially after 6+ months. I still drink alcohol but now a limited variety of stuff that I truly like the flavor of rather than eh it's here so I'll drink it. Also I don't drink when I'm in a bad place or anything traumatic happened that day/week. It's just a recipe for bad. I don't do any other drugs and I'm allergic to smoke so can't speak on that. I also drink 0 caffeine but that's mostly due to stomach issues--not sure if that would help or not. Good luck!",1

"Its a bummer, I know exactly how you're feeling. I usually try not not feel too much of anything. I brush off happiness with the knowledge that whatever good happened is a rarity I shouldn't get used to or acknowledge. Sadness is can always be treated with a few stiff drinks or an exhausting run. That kind of thinking makes me pretty numb but I'm okay with it, until I find a consistent source of happiness.",1
"You are in no way the odd man out. never once spoken to someone who have *something* that they worry about. Whether grades or work or their looks or their friends or personal achievements or their health or even something they said 5 years ago and still feel bad about. Everyone worries about something, and you or I are no exception. Everyone has two sides: the external self which they show to the world, and the internal self which they hide. All you are seeing is what they want you to see: their happiness and confidence and success. What they hide are their fears, their worries, their guilt, and even their unrealistic dreams. It may seem like the outsider looking in, but I promise you that what you are feeling is very ordinary and natural. You are not alone.",1

"You know what? I feel exactly the same and I was trying to be positive for ONCE. I literally am having daily breakdowns because of school right now and honestly I won't make it through this year. The thing is, summer can maybe make you think straight and give you energies to start again, I was trying to say that. Maybe they don't change and stay depressed all summer, but they could try at least. Summer is free time, always. Letting your mind rest is good, even if you don't do a thing.",1

It might be because it's all we've ever known and were scared that anything else will be worse,0

I don't remember the website off the top of my head but just google it. I hope this helps! Good luck :)",1
This was two months ago. How are you now?,0
"I was on a very low dose of Celexa, only 10mg, but that was causing enormous weight gain. I'm really short and I was gaining a pound a month. I tapered off quickly, on the expectation that the mental pain of getting fat this quickly was going to counteract any benefit from the drug. I went off and I'm on gabapentin now, and melatonin, and that usually keeps the insomnia at bay. I used to tell myself meds were a weakness, but being on them is far better than getting fired from a job, which was in the cards if I hadn't gone to see a therapist. I know it feels shameful, but really, it's no different than needing glasses, or a coat when it's cold. If your current meds help you, stay on them, and don't feel bad about it.",1
That depends a lot on your situation. Some people need to find a passion. Some need more social contacts. Did something happen to start your depression?,0

"I know exactly how you feel. just one day of many though. Take it one hour, one minute at a time.

Plan for a nice bath at home, or make/pick up your favorite meal on your way home. You are a wonderful human being and you deserve happiness. Just get through today.

"When you're in the darkest part of a depressive hole it feels like you finally see the truth - that the problem is you and you're stuck with it. But it does come in cycles. I like to start small, take control of whatever I can. Control is empowering. It could be a simple as just playing the shit out of a stupid flash game, or clearing out all the spam in your email, or reorganising your room. Just find something to keep yourself moving. Writing can help too, just lay it all out there. Seeing your words outside your head can help break the downward spiral of thinking. If it's worse now then that means was better, and it will be eventually. Think of someone you can talk to, who knows you well, and just hit them up and say hi. Maybe a text, maybe an email, just remind yourself that you are not alone. It's a shitty battle but stick it out if you can. If you have a therapist try reaching out to one, and if you don't then see if you can get a friend or a parent to help you find one. There's nothing magic about professional help, but it does work sometimes and that's reason enough to get the process rolling if you feel like you can. Send me PM if you want to vent more or anything, you're not alone and you can survive this",1
"Think of all that endured up to this point, all the bad days that beaten and made it through. THAT is courage. This is just another one of those. If feeling like things get any worse, it means that they can only get better. Give yourself a chance to make it kill yourself. going to die one day. In fact, one and only guarantee. one person, a stranger to you... but a stranger that cares. not alone. You can do this. How do I know that? Because here, right now, doing it. Keep going.",1

"Best friends are the acquaintances that go the extra mile. I've had best friends but I have none now. Friends are fluid, they come and go through your life based on your circumstances and interest. I'm not so much lonely as just bored not doing fun things like I used to with friends. I suffer depression but don't need the human contact as much as the next guy. Don't try to make one end all be all friend. You're putting too much pressure on them and yourself. You'll drive them away and crush yourself in the process. Be friendly and caring to all and just see who sticks around. Those are friends. Best friend? Don't look for one, be one.",1

"It's not immature to have suicidal thoughts but it is, however, unfair that you were judged for it. Some people just don't understand how something feels until they experience it themselves.

I don't know how anything feels really, all I know is disappointment or sadness. I am all the time exhausted since I have to put on a show for people, when all I want to do is to close up and go to dance practices. I think the biggest thing I wish would fix itself is that I could feel safe, not walking on constant eggshells:/ Have a happy New Years, I hope this new time brings you all reading this some hope, some recovery, some love, some kindness... sending lots of good energy to your way!",1
"I hate Halloween because I'm not so fucking fascinated with pop culture (I'm a miserable pretentious douchebag.) This big deal Halloween party I didn't go to this year is just a bunch of cosplayers walking around in a warehouse going oh, what are you? Cooool great job! And then awkwardly moving on because you don't actually know anyone. Just these alienated masks, colors and bodies.",1
"I agree. This is a good reminder. Thank you. I remember realizing that the way I treated myself was much harsher than I would treat anyone else.

"The simple answer is to just go do it. You set goals and you force yourself to complete them. Start small and work up, I will work out for 1 hour or I will only game for 1 hour then I will do something else or I will only have 1 *junk food of choice* today. Lifestyle changes don't happen overnight. You need to set realistic expectations and goals. Then slowly over time build towards the you you want to be.",0
"Stop expecting so much from it (assuming). Just accept whatever that comes. Do your best. If not, you still have the rest of your life.

Or at least I hope so.",1
"I'm unsure of your situation but, I want to tell you that there is such a thing called the negativity bias. It might just be not seeing the success that is occurring, trust me it sucks as I am trying to get over it myself. maybe taking a moment and thinking about a small victory and how you can expand on that victory might help. But no matter what I want you to succeed.",1
I am sorry I'm alive,1
"Cause young &amp; loved and it gets better , trust me !! You just gotta learn how to float the waves",0
Yes. There will be more good things to come. Thats how you accept the end of a good thing. By knowing that there are new and intriguing experiences waiting to be revealed.,1
Same. Been suffering for 4 years already. Can't wait to end college.,1
Happiness is a label. A ton of people here think they should be feeling something that they won't. Everyone feels actual happiness; too many don't pay it any attention.,0
I'm so sorry to hear that. I know there's not much I can really say to help. I hope they are happy wherever they are. Were you close? I hope you are handling the passing okay.,1
And I'm also too scared.,1
"I can't remember the last time I was happy, seriously. But I think I understand you. You are so used to being depressed like it's your normal state of being? And then you can feel this tiny bit of happiness and it feels strange, like you don't deserve it? I think you do deserve it.",1
You should talk to them,0

"Glad you didn't. Made you stronger, remember that. You will make it. One day at a time.",1
"Well, get up, have a shower and do something productive with your day. Finish that book you've always wanted to. Watch that movie you've been waiting to see. Make yourself an amazing dinner or better yet, make some cookies for your workmates. Go visit an animal shelter. Get outside for a walk. Everyone has days where they don't want to human. It's up to you though, if you are wanting to try. Xoxo",0
"Being alone is terrible. I'm sorry you're alone. If I hear an implicit request for a suggestion in there, then I suggest doing just about anything different. Anything, really. Break your horrible, lonely routine. The only thing worse than lonely sadness is the certainty that it will not change. What can you do differently tomorrow?",1
Same. I used to go to a psychiatrist through my university but since I graduated havent been to see one. It's been 7 months and I have an appointment in August with a new dr. but I'll need to do something by Monday because tomorrow is my last dose of bupropion. These last couple of months have been awful. I have no motivation to do anything which is why I'm out of medication. I've procrastinated and it sucks. When I was seeing the dr. I would actually be happy. Like have moments where I just feel at peace and truly happy. I miss the fuck out of those moments. At least before I didn't know what I was missing.,1

"Direct anger and expression can certainly have fantastic short-term gains: if you want someone to hurt like you have, you can hit them. If you are hungry, you can kill that guy eating a taco and then eat the taco for yourself. It may be important to consider the long-term effects: how does that anger affect the long-term goals? What are your long-term goals with them?",0
"I experience this all the time. It increases when I'm in an especially bad place, like I am now.  I feel part of a completely different universe to this one. So near yet so far away. It's horrible but there are times it feels peaceful. It doesn't scare me anymore, and I'm not quite sure why. Maybe because I've been experiencing this for years?",1
Is there anything I can do to help?,1
"Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Honestly? Never better.",0
"About a week ago I was damn near rock bottom and told one of my closer friends that I was seriously considering suicide, and needed a reason to not go through. This is a long ass quote, but it helped me. It's somewhat personal, but I think the message can be applied to anyone &gt;Life is bullshit and it's full of the shittiest people. I suffered from major depression but I also live by a philosophy. Life is so bullshit - but it's those small moments that make it worth it. Those small, sometimes dumb, moments where you just smile thinking about it. Our conversations, graduating school, seeing a new member in your family being born. It's the small things that bind us together and make it worth the suffering &gt;It hurts like fucking hell. But this life was worth having if it mean[s] coming in and making you smile, even once. Making someone's day. Being in someone's life....",1
"Definitely talk to your doctor if the lack of energy and motivation is interfering with your job, relationships, or quality of life. Even if it's not that serious it still might be worth seeing your doctor just to be sure that it's SAD.

Not getting better for me either :/,1
No it wouldn't. What happened?,1
"I've definatley been there, but if I've learned anything through my depression, deployments, college and life in general is that it always gets worse before it start s to get better. And I know how cliche that might sound but I can vouch for it. Life isn't going to be easy, whoever says it is, is fucking lying. Life is about perception, mentality over reality. You are strong enough to survive, you can make it, but you have to believe in yourself. Don't let people, or work, or circumstance dictate you. Only let yourself dictate who you are. You can do this",1
From what read only if an immidiate threat to yourself they will trace your call and call the cops. quote me on that though as not 100% certain.,0

"I can only be less sad around kids. They have this energy and innocence that take some sadness out of me. I play with them, make them laugh, feed them, wash their hands. But, I am not around kids very often (I don't have children of my own and relative's kids I see them once a year). But yeah I know what makes me feel better for now. Find what makes you fee less sad, don't aim for the extreme fun and happiness all at once, just less sadness is good.",1
Hey mine is in two days as well! My friend today was telling me to make plans for it and I responded with the most disentrested eh yeah maybe.,1
"Yes. Usually when multiple things line up nicely. Example: Got good sleep, the weather is nice, and some dude on posted a video of his dog running around with a gopro.",0
Same here man. at the point where all I can say is fuck life,1
"If you feel like you have nothing else and have tried the alternatives such as meds and therapy, what would it hurt to try? What would you be leaving behind? Are there alternatives? Do you have a plan for when you got there? Unfortunately you can't live simply on beautiful views and sunshine but a new start may be nice",0
Just fucking do it. what could go wrong. Make your life about being grateful for everything and you will not be disappointed. Stay busy. don't let yourself get lost in anything but her. make loving her your first and for most job and you will never be disappointed or sad.,1
"I mean we only really notice the happy, smiling people because they look and sound the loudest. If you looked around campus I'm sure you'd see that most of us are sad, lonely fucks too",0
"No, that is just really bad withdrawal. Don't confuse that for how you were without them.",0
"My word of advice is just, be careful. If you genuinely feel like you can make it work again, then go for it, but if there's that doubt or feeling that you're going to get hurt again, it might be best to step away. Sometimes you can get back with an ex and it all goes well, but when it doesn't they can get in your head lay their eggs and just dominate every moment of thought. Look at your options and determine what the best result will be for yourself",0
"You mean a romantic relationship, right? Yeahh.. a big part of me wants that, too. But I know I'm not ready. Fortunately, you can be loved in close friendships. Also.. kinda friends with benefits things, too. I personally find those a lot less intimidating.",0
"Have you tried exploring out of your circle of people? I've had trouble making friends too but I found that when I put myself out there by taking a part time job or some sorts, I ended up meeting new people who aren't all that bad actually. As to the depression and anxiety, have you seen someone for that?",1
I don't feel a connection with anyone. After a while I always end up hoping the date will end soon so I can be by myself again cause it doesn't feel right :s,1
"I think it just could be that you're tired from all the pain and suffering you endured throughout the day, and (as you've said) feel that you dont deserve the bed. But trusy me, that bed will be the greatest thing in your life. Whether its to sleep in, or cry on, you will feel bettee",1
I'm so sorry you feel that way. Would you like to elaborate? I'm here if you need to chat,1
Sometimes I'll go back and watch some of my favorite scenes from childhood tv shows. Really lifts my mood.,0

"Not really they are trained to spot people who are just trying to get drugs for whatever reason. It's harder than you might imagine. But there are a few who see our point of view, you might get lucky but doubt it.",0
"You could always leave them and find your own indipendence, sorrounding yourself with the people you love which are not part of your family. Idk your situation actually, but I felt the same way too many times, so lonely and neglected by the ones that should care the most. It happens, but this perception is not necessary the truth. Killing yourself won't solve or change anything.",1
I missed someone who care either. Let go of all of those feelings. Write it down and just throw it away. It really did help me a bit. Get your mind off things with other activities. I know you can get through this if I can!,1
"I'm pretty young so I haven't experienced much death in my family- maybe my advice isn't the best- but go ahead and grieve. Remember them. The next few days will be tearful and difficult. But then you will be able to pick yourself back up again. Recall the happy times and miss them- get it out, so later on when the pain starts to leave you are left only with good memories.",1

"Well I dont know what to say, do you know why you feel that ? Is there any reason ? It could be a good start for discussion. It's your life, your story and when I thought hard about suicide, I told to myself that my story wont end like that, not yet at least.",1

"You say you'll never be able to move out . . . sure you will! would you be moving to a new city or some where farther away? obviously, to move out, you will need a good paying job and money for an apt (by your self or with roommates.) tell your family that you are moving out on X date, if you are over 18, they can't really do anything about it. tell the police that you are moving away and your family is triggering your depression. they might try to file a missing person report if they notice that you go missing out of no where. suicide, I don't think, is ever the answer.",1
"Sorry to hear that man. What are you studying? Do you feel like the material you are studying is hard, or is the volume of the work too much?",1
"Everyone's problems are real. It's not a contest. If something is bothering you, then it's a problem. It doesn't matter if others have it worse. Emotions don't work like that. You wouldn't say Well, I was happy, but everyone seems happier, so I guess I'm not happy. Your feelings are just as important and valid as anyone else's.",1
"Everyone wants to forget something. But most of the time, we can't. Memories make us human. Good memories, bad memories, they really shouldn't make a difference now. That's the past. Try and focus on the present and the future. Even if you create bad memories, try and overcome them with positive, lovely and beautiful ones. I've been through this, and still am going through it, but I find it calming to talk to someone I love and care about. Maybe that could help you too!",1
"It's not about what you do at work though it's what you do with your time outside of work. Most people's dreams don't come true no, that doesn't mean you should just waste away in a pitiful existence. Find excitement in things. Work hard. Achieve things. See progress. I've been in your place, completely cynical and want nothing to do with the way that society feels we should be. The truth is, you can find comfort in being yourself and falling into where you should be. Dreams of things exist because people see the start of something and then only the end of it (being famous, having lost all that weight etc...). That's not reality, and more people have worked hard for what they have.",1
I always try to find something to look forward to even if its small like i cant kill myself until i get some soup and just keep finding little things like that,0
his friend is depression and his friend is telling him 'no',0
so sorry my friend. I hope found something or someone to help you fill a part of that void.,1
"Being depressed [over something short-term] and having depression aren't the same things. That said, to answer your question I'd actually think it should be much easier to comfort someone who is depressed if you are as well because you understand what they are feeling first hand.",0
"His reasoning is absolutely no excuse. It is certainly not your fault. It really does, as others have said, seems like you would be better off without him.",1
"What I'm trying to say is that routine is significantly important, and the first thing many clinical psychologists ask is if you have a job (basically makes you set up a routine) And routines make you less likely to develop depression if they are balanced and will make your enjoyment of life increase as well",0
"People who give that advice probably have those things working for them, but they don't realize that none of it helps depression. Being outdoors just makes me feel lonely as hell and without companionship. And if you're depressed, a hobby can't help you out either because if you have no drive to do anything, a hobby cannot satiate what you're truly desiring. Just try going after what you truly desire, and chip away at it.",1
"Time is money, they say. I've got all the time in the world and Im just throwing it away. Might as well save some other people some time by stopping mine.",0
We say we want to die because all we actually want is life to deal us a better hand but we don't know how to get it.,0

"Don't end your life, change your life. Take control and only accept the good things YOU want in your life. Somebody calls you with some bullshit...hit the bullshit button (click) and keep on moving ahead. The same with real life. You don't HAVE to accept anything in your life you don't want to. It's your mind, control it or focus it on what you want to focus it on. Get a goal, get a plan, and get off your ass. Hope some of that helps.",1
"Stop trying to fix things with bad people and bring positive people into your life. If you can't do that, having no one is better than having the worst people.",0

You too must be passing a bad time there but don't let that makes you kill yourself you are worth living. You are a beautiful human being and you have the chance to go on. Hope it changes your mind. I'll be there for you if you need me.,1

"get through this! Remember, suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. And you will get passed this phase in your life eventually. Things will get better :)",1
"Being home alone often puts me in a really dark place. I try to stay out of the house, even if I'm still alone on my laptop at a library or a coffee shop, it feels more connected and sane. I hope you start to feel better.",1
"Sometimes I envy those who are sad... I feel as though it's better than being a hollow emotionless being such as myself. I hope things get better for you, good luck :)",1
Maybe because you crave for very meaningful relationships? Because I do.,0
"I understand your thought process but hiding or lying will make it worse for you and for them (when they find out the truth). I have adopted a policy of soft truth when talking about depression with loved ones. Let me explain: There is some drama inherent to despair - you feel all alone, like nothing will ever get better, you feel like you're choking on it, etc. And that's a lot for normal people to deal with. So I try to state the facts like a robot and not be super descriptive or let myself get too worked up. Keeping my cool helps them do the same, and it's not really a lie, I'm just choosing how much I want to express. It's like I'm a bottle of soda that's been really shaken up, and if you take the cap off like normal it's going to explode all over your face. But if you do it really slowly you let the carbonation out in a manageable way and then you can drink your soda and everyone's happy.",1
Might wanna see a doctor about that,0
Something is better than nothing at least. Even if it isnt positive its at least cathartic.,0

"I hate T.V in general. All those fake ass shows with acting makes me throw up in my mouth. My parents think that it's 'entertaining because it's real', no, it's entertaining because they're paid to be entertaining.",1
Depression can be cyclical. Our brain's chemistry gets out of whack and we feel like crap for a few days and then we feel better when it gets back to normal. Good luck and try to push through it.,1
Same. I had a really fun dream where I made new friends at college. It felt so real and I wish I could live in it...,1
"Oh... if a boss did that to me, I'd debate the heck out of him and put a mirror against him to make him understand his flaw/s (unless feelings of job loss risks arise) No boss is going to get away with putting his workers down, as ideally we're meant to cooperate together and not be slaves of one another.",1
sorry you feel this way. I do too. It provides a release.,1
"I know you mean well, but this really help a large majority of people with depression. Plenty of people afford professional help, or it work for them. Some people, myself included, make any friends at all. The negativity, among other things, that comes with this illness is like a poisonous cloud that brings other people down with you and ultimately pushes them away.",1
LMAO you have no clue what your'e talking about.,0
Maybe it's anxiety or a tension headache. I have depression/anxiety. Have them all the time.,1
I go to bed around 1 am and wake up at least twice. It's really tiring but I am already used to it.,1
"I have a cat. I know this sounds ridiculous, but a little dumb and he really needs me to take care of him. If I brush my teeth, get cavities. I have health insurance and his food budget spent on fixing my teeth when I could have prevented it. So I brush my teeth. I have to get up and go to school and work because depending on me with his tiny little life. I have to get up period because he needs breakfast in the morning. I have to keep going because he loves me and his person and no one to care for him if gone. So I suck it up and I do it for him. Plus a great cuddle partner when I cry and I have to sleep alone anymore. I also started walking him, like on a leash like a crazy person walking him. I got him because he was trapped inside my moms car and had a lifelong fear of cars. Whenever he hears one he panics and tries to hide and gets himself stuck places. But he also loves to be outside. So I walk the little guy on a leash. And he gets to go outside and I have to exercise. Half the time we end up down the block sitting in the middle of the sidewalk with him curled up panicked in my lap because he heard a car, but hey were outside. Basically my cat is more broken then I am and smaller so I gotta function best I can for the both of us.",1
"People say this because people are hopeful. They know that depression is something that turns you against yourself. That depression changes you so you dont even realize that those dark thoughts in your head even you. Depression is a parasite. I have dealt with depression and anxiety for over a decade and I always thought to myself it will get better on its own. But truth be told, it just kept getting worse and worse. I had to reach out for help before it got better. Personally, it took me time to figure out that anxiety and depression a part of me. It is not who I am, it is something that afflicted me. Many times anxiety and depression isnt a burden you can lift yourself. It takes support and continuous work to overcome. Depression and anxiety is definitely something that can get better, it just takes time to find the right ways to overcome it.",1
"You are not a loser- I promise. Give yourself some credit for starting a new job, and give yourself time to make new friends there.

"IT is a sector in boom right now. There are tons of jobs and its only growing. You will have no problem finding a job whatsoever, however i understand your worry is money. Even after you get a job, keep looking, and applying. The more experience you have the better. You can probably find jobs that pay higher and higher. Idk how far youre in right now through your course, but if it's not too late, try taking some security courses as well. While IT is in a boom, having security courses on your resume would almost guarantee that you will always have a job. Literally every company needs help with security, and they're will to pay lots of money to find it. Everything will be fine.",1

This is a perfect place to vent your mind if you want to continue.,0
Will pray for you my friend.,1
Your attitude is what we need more. Society has its 'standards' that actually make us unhappy. Embrace who you are with all the bright and dark sides and don't force yourself to hide the dark sides; that's what we're taught to do but it's the root for unhappiness.,0
Talk to your doc about Seroquel. I got it for falling asleep but it did wonders for my dreams. Then again I usually have decent dreams to begin with.,1
"I realize I had depression for a long time, and sometimes I still doubt I do but that may just be the illness. I just sort of always felt sad, or at most neutral, but I had a good job, finished school, and an active social life. It was the little invisible things that nobody ever saw. Staying in bed awake for hours on weekdays, intentionally isolating myself or lying so I could be alone and mope. I stopped exercising and gained a ton of weight. Hell I even had suicidal ideation and I just thought it was normal. I want to kill myself but I stop thinking about death and me dying. It sometimes felt like if I stopped existing it would be fine. I knew something was wrong but I was adamant it depression. Then I went to my doctor thinking I had an anxiety problem and he began to ask THE questions. I knew he was trying to see if I had depression and it caught me by surprise. Of course I lied for most of them. It would be embarrassing; there was no way I was depressed, but the thought had worked its way in. Over the course of a year I did some idle research. I realized suicidal thoughts and a fascination with death are not normal. I matched a lot of my behavior to symptoms of depression. I came to accept it. All said I was depressed for 3+ years before I realized it.",1
Why do you think so?,0

Though since you know youre going to stick around a while longer, shittiness and all, might as well try a few crazy ideas to change your brain to like living, yeah? Might not work, but I don't imagine you have other big plans. I'm working with a psychiatrist to try a few treatments (medications). I talk to a therapist. I make myself visit the few rare friends who get it. I sometimes go running. Some days I don't hate living. Some days I do. But I at least want to know I tried everything before I leave.",1

I'm sorry. I hope you get a good day soon.,1
"There is as much of a point as there is someone who invented that point.  To compare a finite life to an infinite time will always seem meaningless to that life. What can be more productive is to think in terms of the finite and not the infinite. I can create meaning with my life: I can set up goals and pursue them. This is subjective, dynamic meaning that is ever-changing, but it is my meaning, and it is meaning in life. To compare these accomplishments to something infinite will always make them seem meaningless, but that's only because you changed the frame of reference.",0

You have to understand, the thoughts inside your mind aren't made up out of anything. People don't see your thoughts, they see your actions, and your actions are made out of being you. You are the mind floating in an ocean with waves of thoughts, you just have to let the thoughts pass. Don't try to block them, don't go into them. Just let them pass and hang onto something in your life.",0
Hey i know it sucks right now. But it could get better but you got to keep going. You want to talk about it?,1
Wow. I'm seriously in the same exact position. It sucks man. Dated a girl I care deeply about but deep down I know I'm better off alone (or at least the depression says I am). Can't decide if we should just end it or continue. I'm gonna have a ton of regret either way.,1
"Yes, it's because I was unprepared for the job market and just studied and graduated because it was the normal thing to do. I also lost all my marks in a very short time and had personal issues to solve caused by my own bad decisions. I did not make enough place for other important aspects of life during my studies. It was a big mental struggle to realize that but I am slowly getting back on tracks.",1

Would you feel better (1) sticking to a renewed promise to not drink and thus having to forego drinking every time you feel the need in the future or (2) abandoning your promise and dealing with whatever direct and indirect harm befalls you from the drinking?,0
Dead but what does fully grown up mean? I have my own house and a job etc. Am I fully grown up now?,0

I have had 2 shitty jobs in the past and every day I just told myself to suck it up and one day I will have a job I love. I, like you, had trouble finding replacement jobs, hell I never even heard back 90% of the time. I gave up for a while then one night I was so pissed at my job I went on Craigslist, searched one more time for the job I wanted, applied to a company and got the job and it has been the best job I have ever had. Hope that helps",1
I truly know how you just going to do my own thing and live for myself and not allow anybody bring me down. I suggest you do the Same,0
terrified of annoying somebody to the point that they just leave me,0
"I know all too well what you mean. People scare and anger me, have for years, and as a result I don't actually have a single person I would consider a friend and have never had a relationship, but I crave that stuff every night. It causes hard insomnia worrying about if I'll have to be alone forever with no friends or partners to the point I can only sleep out of exhaustion, but then once I have and I wake up the next morning, I'll loathe that I have to go outside and interact with people for work. It's a daily nightmare. I would say that MAYBE, if I gave advice on it, it would be that I used to have a similar thing with shyness, and with that I pushed myself into more and more social situations and now am not so shy. It MAYBE might work the same way with liking/disliking social interaction. But I do that everyday and I still don't like people. I'm more COMFORTABLE around them, but I still don't LIKE them. And it's an entirely different ball park with depression/anxiety than shyness, otherwise if it were so easy to just 'force' yourself to socialize to fix the problem, I'd be doing it myself. If pushing yourself into those situations does help, I hope you find the courage to do it sometime, buddy.",1
My friend said something like that to me recently. It fucking hurt. I could tell if I was more pissed at her or myself.,1
"I feel similarly. I'm not on here all the time, but every couple of months I find myself coming onto this sub just to read through posts and see if anyone else out there gets it, or to try and comfort someone/lend an ear to listen to.

There doesn't necessarily need to be an external (or immediately visible) reason to be depressed. Sometimes it can be (as you suspected) be genetic and run in the family. Do you have anyone to talk to? Can you go to a school counselor?,0

"In my experience, when meds start working, you slowly start having good days now and then. You may get like two good days, three bad days, some good days again etc. Until you keep getting more and longer stretches of good days. For me it's actually a sign that the meds are working. Don't worry about work too much, your health is more important and is your priority right now.",1
"I personally haven't, but from what I've read online a great deal of people don't regret it, they only feel shame because they failed and already plan their next attempt.

lol same but how can you help that,1
Its hard to describe it but here is my attempt: Its still a void but warmer. Instead of everything being dark its more grey and bright and warm. Your Heart is at rest and can relax a little. You start to enjoy little things again like the clouds or a funny tv show. Its a slow progress but shouldnt take two months. Talk to your doc. Mine said you know if it works within a month.,1

"The thing about depression is that it's not at all about feeling sad...it's about feeling nothing. Nothing matters, nothing makes you feel anything. People turn to things like drugs and self-harm in order to feel something, even if it's deadly.",0

"When I have this reoccurring thought, it involves me driving alone at night. Windows down with the light breeze keeping me cool. Music to last me the whole ride. Where would I go? know, probably hop on a freeway and drive North till I get hungry. Pull off and find something make me happy. No map, no google maps, no plans, just my SUV so I can layout and sleep in the back, an aux chord to have something playing, enough nicotine to go the whole ride. Most importantly, space. Just some time and energy to solely focus on whatever it is my head get through. I have this thought periodically, know if or when this trip may come but I like to think it will.",1

"I literally have had this fantasy, ever since I was in middle school, one day just leaving and going out into the woods or something in the middle of nowhere, becoming entirely self sufficient, living with little to no human contact, and eventually just dying with no one to care or notice. Is it bad that I find this to be a nice fantasy?",1

"sorry you feel this way. I have been crying and sleeping for a whole week now, and now I feel worse then ever because I been productive with my free time. Just think about how one day, you will look back on this and wonder why it was ever a problem. This day will come, however long it takes for you to get there. Take your time, blame yourself or punish yourself for feeling this way. This something you have control over and pushing yourself to achieve happiness will only result in a breakdown. Good luck",1

"My boyfriend and i officially broke up yesterday. The pain you are feeling is not foolish nor is it you being weak. When we tend to get into relationships we often more time than not replace friendships with our partners. And as time progresses the person is not just simply a partner but a friend whom is apart of the very foundation our life is build upon. I am not sure why you two broke up. And i know it hurts extremely bad, and life has lost much of its meaning. I will it try to come up with some lighthearted crap that tells you everything is going to disappear quickly. This will be tough, this will hurt, and at times it will feel like nothing at all is worth living for. But i must tell you this feeling is temporary..... it will not last forever. How long it will last i cannot say, when it will end i cannot say either. But take it one day at a time. Do things that are only necessary for your existence. And those that are extra if you are not up to it do it. Within the relationship i am sure there were flaws on both parts, beat yourself up about them. When the time is right started to fix those things. And if in months or weeks time you feel like you want to reach out to see if anything can be rekindled do so. But you as a person have to stand alone so if or when this may happen it will not shake your entire life. Become strong from this.",1
"That's possible, but you would still have to land on the high end of all probabilities. You shouldn't let you looks hold you back. Genes don't matter as much as health consciousness and maintenance. Some of the ugliest, crud genetics individuals I've known in my life put a lot of effort into things and have turned out to be quite remarkable people. I've allowed myself to rot and am just living it up in the human decay cycle.",1
I do feel that. I am 21 years old. Taking my life one day at a time.,1

"I completely understand what you mean. Every day is a fight. Just getting through. Waiting for... something. Nothing. I get it. Luckily, I only feel like this part of the time. Good luck, friend. Keep putting one foot in front of the other and pushing through. Maybe some day, whatever we're waiting for and trying to get to will actually happen and it won't be a struggle anymore.",1
"This question kind of reminds me of the book before and it has you questioning these same concepts and to be honest there is no right answer. Life is all about what you do with it, if you do anything then...? You bring up something being a permanent problem, but unless you can see into the future you really know that.",0
"Me too. I pray every night that I die. But yet, here I am...",1
"I mostly just try to keep myself busy with the things I enjoy. Digital drawing, writing, browsing, and watching my favorite shows. I've started doing these in school too just to distract myself from the crippling loneliness every day. I just started 10th grade so I'll have to relearn how to keep my grades up when crying and hating myself are on my mind 24/7...just know you're not alone in this. We'll get through it, somehow.",1
"I often feel the same. But you know, your parents are human beings too. They will eventually hurt you one day by saying something or doing something wrong... it's normal. But it is your family and they love you and you love them. So you can forgive them and try to understand what happened and why it happened. Then, you can try to make it never happens again. If you're depressed it's not your fault. If you are sick it's not your fault either. They want to help you because you're their child. It's normal for them to help you and you don't have to pay them back for that. Don't be too hard on you. You seem like nice person ! Good luck",1
"Don't worry, we are mortal for a reason.",1
Well I don't anymore. I may hate myself but I'm done pandering. Anyway aren't we always pandering to each other?,1

Depends. If you are a girl it could be your monthly breakdown.,0
"Same. I fantasize about shooting myself in the mouth, feeling the gun's cold black metal on my lips, hearing the trigger click, and being finally free from this bullshit.",1
hey !  you tried seeing a specialist ?,0
Talk about it to a therapist or ANYONE. talking about it helps tremendously. Call a suicide hotline if you have no one to talk to. You would be surprised how much just talking about your issues helps.,0

I've been depressed since I turned 10. From what my therapist says it's not uncommon for the beginning of chronic depression to coincide with the begining of puberty. I think that's when it started for me.,1
"Good for you. I had a pretty minor drinking habit that I caught and acted on relatively quickly, and I still think about drinking more days than not despite it having been a while now. I'm always amazed at how powerful the sensation of craving can be, and can't imagine what people who've drank heavily for years and years must go through in quitting. Not drinking is one the better things I've done in my life, and the benefits seem to compound the longer you go. My brain seems to work considerably more efficiently, and I continue to feel and overwhelming sense of clarity that wasn't present when I drank. This is all despite still dealing with my mental illness bullshit; obviously things aren't great all the time, but they'd be a lot worse if I still drank a lot frequently.",1
"Hey, mind sharing what your situation is so i can maybe help you?",1
Yes. I feel like if I'm not being helpful/useful then I'm pretty much worthless,1
I don't know how to stop either. My negative thoughts are with me all the time.,1
Yeah I have trouble getting up too. I need my boyfriend to help me stand/walk.,1

That's awesome. Huge props to you! I haven't gotten that far yet because mine was so well-written (lol) and I'm not convinced I won't need it again. But that'll be a next step for me too.,1
"I just can't stand the social media shit. I was really messed up as a kid, chemical imbalance at birth, obese until I was 22, put on antipsychotics around 13. Stupidly stopped taking them and I just got more and more detached from reality. Combined with my very mild ASD I never really got to have much interaction with other kids outside of school, never even really had friends I would talk to during the day. I never learned how to be an adult when it comes to relationships (of all kinds). Because society just developed that way, I guess. Everybody is on their damn phones. God forbid you want to ... *gasp* ... walk up and say hi to someone on the street. I went to university last year and it was a bit better, and liberating, but I still had big trouble connecting with anyone. I made one good friend (my roommate) and met a couple people on Tinder, I tried to go to school clubs and be proactive and not feel sorry for myself. But I just can't connect with anyone unless they are literally forced to be in a room with me, apparently. When I go back I will try to smile more. That's what everyone keeps telling me. To answer your question, I don't think I am depressed because of how we live. I'm depressed because of what essentially amounts to bad luck. But it sure as hell makes my life a lot harder. At the same time, we are lucky to live the comfortable lives we do nowadays. If I had been born in another time, who can say if I would even be alive right now?",1
It's okay to have a shitty day. It's allowed to defeat you occasionally. What happened?,1
Don't be scared. Reaching out for help is what you have done with this post and it's small steps that count towards the big goal. Use an anonymous forum for a while to talk if that's what you need. When you feel ready to speak to a doctor please do it.,1

Im in the same situation. In fact I dread going to sleep and I dread having to wake up.,1
Actually I get this a lot. Can't bake a fucking cake? Can't use the coffee machine without creating a mess? Can't make a stupid toast AND drop it? I don't know if it's helpful but right after such things happened I imagine how hundreds of other people on earth experience the same situation right now. Helps me sometimes.,1
"For at least the last 4 or 5 years I've also felt like there's not really any point in living, and yet.... I'm still here. If only to spite all the people who think you aren't strong enough to make it, There's always a reason to hang on :) you matter and you deserve good things.",1
"It's true in certain contexts. When you're at the lowest point of depression? Yes, it's going to get better. Depression, overall? Probably not going anywhere. Life? No promises. Could get better or worse.",0

I don't post in r/depression, well because it says to Do not post or respond with: it gets better messages. How does that make you feel? I find that ridiculous lol. I hope you find what makes your life worth living. The truth is, whoever you are, wherever you are.. Life *does* get better, more than you can imagine.",1
It's 8pm here and I just woke up. Eases the sting if you sleep the day away,0

There have been multiple times where I wondered if this was a good idea for me, but I have 3 pets at home so it could never be an option unless I were married or something. Lol. Anyway, know you are brave and I am so proud of you for taking initiative to help yourself. You deserve to get better and I believe in you!",1
I'm sorry that you're also in this position. I'm honestly just waiting for my parents to die so I can kill myself.,1
"When I first began to feel miserable and anxious all the time, had insomnia too. Some nights I wouldnt sleep at all. Today I don't get good sleep, however I sleep enough.

Even when I get 8-10 hours of sleep, I'm tired. It's infuriating. I never feel well rested, I just feel like I need a good night's sleep to fix myself... But a good night's sleep does not exist.",1
"quite a few things ive noticed for myself. ill over simplify my thought process to get the point across. Ill list them quickly. I thought that if I could go through physical pain, then I can go through mental pain. A physical scar is easier to understand that an emotional one. Having to tend to my wounds to stop the bleeding and cover them up distracted me from what I really wanted to tend to and cover up. There was a couple times where I self harmed because my thoughts were too overwhelming while I was trying to fall asleep. Afterwards, I would spend some time in the bathroom alone, taking care of my bleeding and by the time it was all finished, I forgot what I was thinking about. Self harm was an effort to try and beat life at its own game. If life was beating me up, maybe if I did a better job at that than life then maybe the punches life throws at me seem so bad. since moved on from this. These mindsets were unhealthy for me but recognizing them was essential to my own recovery.",1
yes. wanna vent to each other? just pm me,1
"Meh, life is what you make of it, and that can either be very scary or quite comforting. Personally, I am at a point where I feel circumstantially helpless and genetically inferior... so I am hopeless. But, tbh, everything is about your perspective and what you choose to focus your attention on. If you have the mental stregnth to seek help, get on medication, pursue interests you like and meet people through them and accept your reality, than maybe just maybe you can get better. Life is, in my opinion, just a series of accomplishments, experiences, relationships and habits... you need to have a groove and stick with it. Firstly, just be happy with yourself. You gotta do anything to make yourself like your own company and brain. Become your own best friend.",0
"Unfortunately, yes :( for me at least. It causes big problems in my relationship and it sucks. It might not be that way for everyone though",1
Yeah. I do that too. Stupidest part is that I have absolutely no reason to be anything except happy and productive.,1
"I don't know why you think all that but I've felt the same... I still feel that way, only less. People don't understand that is not possible to give general advices for concrete problems... I hate when they do it.  It sound that you only wanted to get what you feel out, that's cool. I want to let you know you are the only one feeling that way. I have a big issue with my physical appeareance, I recently started going to gym to improve my confidence but I have to accept that what I hate the most of myself I won't be able to change it.  Many days, I find the energy to keep living thinking that maybe I can help someone that is feeling like me. That really helps me. Many non cannon people achieves a lot of stuff, that makes me feel better many times.",1

It might be your problem but you have to fight it alone. Humans are social animals. We survive by relying on each other. The group helps you when your down and in return you help the group when your good. You are down now and you can ask for help,0
"I get this to. I used to feel great then when I became depressed it started to trigger my anxieties. It's hard to know whether it enlightens you to things you didn't want to know or whether the it's just making you paranoid, but regardless it makes me feel down. It affects all people differently. Only thing I could suggest is having a beer or something with it to try and reduce your anxiety.",1
"I don't think I've failed that much but that's because I rarely have the power to try anything in the first place. I have no idea where I'm going. I know where I want to, but it takes so much effort to get there and I don't know if I'll have that ability time soon. What happened that brought you to this point?",1
"That pointless feeling, like 'why?' I hear you on that.",1
I don't think I could answer any better than this.... Definitely agree.,1
Yeah i have. I spent a lot of time last year doing that to no avail. Still just as numb and dead inside as i was before.,1

"People don't really care about anything other than themselves. Not applicable to everyone of course, but using people as a means to an end is common and people don't care how you feel as long as they get what they want.

"There are tons of opportunities out there that can help you earn decent money. This includes: website testing, taking surveys, data entry, transcription, virtual assistant, and so on. Can I suggest you something? It's a process to recover from your depression. 1. The first thing you should do is to find out the top three things, basically your skills that you are good at and which can help you in some way for getting online jobs. 2. Make a list of such jobs that you can opt for as per your top three skill-sets. 3. The next thing is to look for free or paid online resources to learn about that job and start applying. I would suggest starting with some easy job that you can find without any trouble. For instance, you can do data entry in the beginning. After a few months, you can start doing transcription work, and then maybe move on to become a virtual assistant. So in this way, you will ultimately start earning a decent earning on your own. I hope this may help you. All the best!",1
True. Not long ago i reached a point where even taking a shower was a battle because of anxiety and depression. Doing the dishes. The laundry. Cooking. Going to do the groceries. All battles with myself. Emprisonned in my own brain. I understand you. Keep up.,1

"Cutting the topside of my arms hurt and bled but they clotted pretty quickly. Please use a sterile blade if you're going to cut yourself, and don't go any deeper than just the surface skin. Take it from me as someone who has used self-harm, an infection is not the sort of pain that helps with emotional relief! I also recommend other methods, there are plenty out there that can cause some pretty gnarly pain but are far, far safer than cutting. Are there any taps in your house that have overly hot water? Boiling water shouldn't be used as it will scald and is just as prone to infection and other nasties as cutting, so just try clenching a fist under the regular hot water for a few seconds. On the other end of the scale I found the grabing an ice cube and squeezing as tight as I could helped! I thought it would just make my hand feel numb, but it creates a localised, sharp unbearable sensation that works wonders to distract me.",1
Same here. Depression made me into a miserable bitter piece of shit when I used to be humble and kind to everyone.,1

Aren't we all? It's basically all there is to life.,0
Actually I find myself taking much longer showers when I'm depressed. Sometimes twice in a day. It's the only time I feel relaxed.,1
"Yup, my therapist described this to me as a triangle: Thoughts fuel feelings which fuel our interactions which fuel thoughts. She said that the only way to escape the loop was to break one of the parts. Obviously breaking interactions would just put on a facade, so she suggested breaking either thoughts by changing perception to be more of what she called rational, (through looking at the ups and downs of any situation instead of deciding based just on the downs) or breaking feelings by re-evaluating them using a similar method. &amp;nbsp; I've always unknowingly found myself back in the loop over and over again, but what I would do in your situation would be to look at things objectively, put a self-aware lens over your life, see what you can do to make it better and make choices from there.",1
"People do actually notice the scars, but they dont know how to react. I had a friend who used to cut herself infront of the whole class. I didn't want anything more than just take that razor blade from her and just giver her a hug, but i was too afraid. Funfact: being afraid in this moment started my depression. About a month ago i was in a train and saw someone sitting with scars on their arms and i wanted to go over and talk to them, but i just didn't know what to say so i didn't go over and i didn't talk to them.",1
"Tbh. I find most people are pressured to 'appear' happy. There's this societal idea that people need to find a 'happy life' or that the pursuit of happiness is the most important part of our lives. Which I honestly think is dumb, cause it implies feeling anything else is meaningless. But feeling depressed does not have less meaning than feeling happy. At least that's my thought",0
Do you want to talk about it?  (I realized that sentence kinda sounds sarcastic wasn't meant to be),1
"Depends on the medication, but yes.",0
"I felt the same way at 16 23 now and things are alright. I got through college with a decent degree and got an ok job and my own place and a few good friends. You can get more freedom with time.

It's good that you are spending quality time with your grandma. Our grandparents are only with us for so long.,1

You don't sound evil to me. Why do you have such a negative opinion of yourself?,1
"Ugh, tell me about it. Although i've been eating, just a lot less than normal,i still just want to lay here and just forget about everything, but laying down leaves me alone with my thoughts always thinking about what was. I've been trying to keep active to keep my mind on other things. You should give it a shot. Go out to a restaurant or something, just get out.",1
"right there with you, not sure it's a positive or negative to dream literally every time I fall asleep.....",1
Go for a walk or run. Get tired so your body feels like shit. Then your mind will focus on that shit feeling instead of making them up. It works for me,1
"Don't tell yourself that's it's going to be a shitty day. Literally force a smile, beat the thoughts in your head into submission. I read once that people who have terrible sleep can lessen the affects of tiredness by telling themselves they had a good sleep, actually vocally saying to yourself I had a great sleep, and it works. It may not completely erase your sleepy eyes, but it's better than being drowsy all day because you keep dwelling on the shit sleep you had the night before. Placebo.",1
You better with an ax or a sword?,0
No you are not a loser in any way. Admiring your depression shows how strong you are. This is something that is hard to get rid of. Believe me I know. important is that you give up and keep moving forward a strong and special person. I believe in you. Have hope. *hug*,1
"An old girlfriend and I have some sort of connection. We both have depression and similar backgrounds growing up. We are able to talk to each other, understand each other. Better than our respective spouses can understand our depression. The only problem is that I'm still not completely over her.

"sadness is not the same as depression. And people trip all the time and others laugh, it's no big deal and no one cares beyond that moment.

Imagine if you were a waiter and dropped some glasses- would you walk right out of the restaurant because people clapped?",1
I'm in your prayers bro. Remember your not alone.,1
"I'm not even my fucking number one. I've tried and then depression steps in, raw physical pain.",1
well it could always be worse lol,0
I'm obsessed with video games and spend a lot of time reading or watching videos about them. Unfortunately my depression keeps me from actually being able to play anything. It sucks so much because now I have nothing to go to when I'm feeling down.,1

"I'm in my 50's and have been struggling with depression since I was a child. In my experience, the teen years were quite difficult, so I would say yes, that it did get better. Until it got worse again. Then better. Then worse. Then better. Many many wonderful things have happened during the good times. And I've survived 100% of my bad times. What I mostly have learned over these decades of illness, is that things always shift, eventually. I rely on docs, meds, therapy, and my spouse in bad times, and basically just ride it out.",1

Yeah I often wonder if I am just negative/ungrateful/lazy/etc or if there really is a legit label for it. Constant battle in my head.,1
Absolutely. I always dream from the POV of someone else (usually imaginary). Reading novels and trying to forget reality feels better too.,0
"I had some major shit go on 2 years ago, mother with a brain tumor, my aunt was selling the place, needed to move, I couldn't function enough to clear her place out and find a place to live.

I am sorry you are going through it too...I am not real hopeful about it getting better for me anytime soon, but I really hope it does for you. it strange that we can believe it can for someone else, a complete stranger on the internet, but not for ourselves? If not happiness, I hope you can find at least some peace and comfort in 2019.",1
"Yeah, with you. longing for the next sincere laugh or anything that I find funny anymore or someone who will play that game with me in real life..",1
"No one's brave for killing themselves. It's the *fear* of living that drives them to end their lives. But something inside you wants to live. If that wasn't true, you'd be dead by now. I'm glad you're still here, and I hope one day you can be too :)",1
"This is so fucking relatable... In every aspect of my life. I know my words won't change anything, but there are others who feel the same. I hope you find your way, OP.",1
"Whenever my one friend who I text is taking too long to reply or has more attitude than usual, I assume that she's either busy talking with people she likes more or just gets fed up talking to me. When my neighborhood friends haven't come to hang out for a while, my automatic thoughts are that they're at another friend's house or at a party having the time of their lives while I sit in my house doing nothing. And at family dinners and birthdays where everyone's happy and getting along, I constantly get the most dark and sickening thoughts in my head that I avoid letting out by ignoring everyone around me. Life sucks :(",0
"and when you cannot even trust yourself, that is when you are the lowest..",0
"Hey there you seem to be going through something, care to share?",1
"Have you tried telling them to get help, therapist, medication, or hospital. You could always call the suicide hotline. I called them when my friend was about to kill herself and it was very helpful.",0
"As long as you arent overdosing there is no reason to get rid of them. Keep them for a rainy day, or if things get consistently worse",0
Is there any chance of reconsideration?,0
"I try too but often erase what I say before posting, as if I know all the answers when I'm here for help too. I feel terrible about staying silent but when its serious as life and death I can never post out of fear..",1
"Be strong my friend, Everytime I come in here, I don't feel so alone. This may sound selfish, but it's good for me to know that there's people out there that feels the pain that I feel every single day. Anyway, have a great day, my friends.",1
"I dunno man, I over come either even with a ton of meds. It really depends on the person.",0
"As a kid there was a brief window of time where I wasn't being bullied as much as I used to, and I had a personality. I made up jokes on the spot, would talk to anyone, was interested in loads of things. Then, something happened and I seemed to just switch off again. It might've been all the rumours that I'd be beaten up by gangs of people every single day in the next school, because I didn't act a certain way. It might've been the continued bullying in that school. Soon enough I was a completely hollow shell once again.",1
Right. Literally wishing to just die in some random accident and it happens to someone who doesn't deserve it. Happy life living people who definitely didn't want to die.,1
"I usually revert to things I loved doing before the depression, like getting on the computer and playing Rollercoaster Tycoon.",1
"Not sure if i want to know , probably take me down to the next level of my depression .",0
"Same boat, man. Seeing happy couples, especially my friends, is like being stabbed in the gut.",1
i wish i had someone like that. i've never been close friends with a girl before and sometimes i doubt whether i'll ever get one let alone a girlfriend,0
I spent entire life alone,1
sorry to hear. :( is this an ongoing thing or does it come in phases? how does being high help?,1
"I know. I don't get it either. If most people were anything like me, human civilization would crumble - would never have started.",1
"Yup. In my experience sertraline was more intense than (es)citalopram the first few days and I started slow at like 12.5mg. It's really the first week - actually about the first 4 days - effect. The thing that requires the black box warning because it's a surprise if no one tells you to expect it (and not everyone gets it so powerfully). If it's too intense talk to your doctor about cutting back and moving up slower (I've settled on 50mg and that was after titrating up). Try splitting it up into at least two doses so it doesn't all hit you at once - sertraline's got a relatively short serum life and I'm preferring a morning and afternoon dose. ... and during this 'jittery' period try to take it at least 4 hours before bed so you'll have a shot at getting some proper sleep. It gets a *lot* more boring (but still potentially helpful) once your body adapts! Right now all sorts of stuff is going on with your serotonin and it's pretty much the 'psychedelic' part. Once your system adjusts the idea is that the drug is holding a 'buffer' of serotonin in the synapses so it's there when you need it for more even moods and less discomfort, but until that settles down it can be pretty trippy and stimulating (especially with sertraline that has a nice extra dopamine stimulatory effect, which is pretty helpful offsetting some of the more annoying SSRI side effects in the longer term). So if you feel like you're going to jump out of your skin now - yeah, that's normal, and it passes in about those 4-7 days (for me, anyway). Also heads-up that.. yeah, with sertraline, those days included a lot of nausea and (ahem) intense GI effects for me too - that passes too.",1
"Its just another day, but another day of triumph because you're still here. It may seem insignifigant, but you are fighting a very difficult war, and today you won the battle. Stay strong OP. Much love.",1
"No don't do that, I live there.",0
come back whenever ur ready. I took two years off b/c of depression and I came back this semester. Honestly its hard af I almost dropped out again but im pushing through...,1
"Fuck happiness, I'm kind of OK not being suicidal. Boring is good",0
"I'm on the same meds, and I just wanted to ask how long it took for you to start feeling the effects.",0
"I always find that crying feels like liquid self pity, but that's probably just cause i'm an asshole to myself a lot.",0
"Wow, looking through your post history makes this hit even harder. :\",0
"Well I can say that I think it's really good that it gets better throughout the day. For me it's the opposite, my mornings are bleh. As the day goes on into the night I feel better, and before bed time I feel depressed. I think everyone is just different and maybe getting your day started gets rid of some mental worries and anticipation",1
Same here. You can tell just by looking at me.,1
"Mental illness can be overpowering . You may feel like you have no control. But please try to hold on , don't give up on yourself .",1
I am sort of in a similar boat. There are lots of people around me but it still feels like entirely alone. prepared to spend most wonderful time of the getting drunk everyday until school starts again. And then starting another draining semester.,1
"I thought I was alone in this, but yeah, sometimes the self hatred/pity/sadness becomes so overwhelming I stop in place and feel like I can't move for any amount of time, be it 10 seconds, or 10 minutes.",1
"This is exactly what I do whenever someone asks something like do you like to How am I supposed to answer that? I like to do anything, I just sit at home and think about how much I hate myself. But I say that because not the answer, so I just make something up.",1
"I do, because no one can change how i feel anyway.",1
the two biggest signs for me are when when i start neglecting my appearance and stop cleaning my room.,1
i'd say that i would have overcame any suicidal thoughts because of my fears ;),1

"You hate yourself? But who is yourself, what do you hate?",0
"This is me every day...I drive 17 miles down a windy rural road fully lined with large hundred year old trees on my way home. People die all the time on my road. I help but feel like speeding and steering into every tree as I come around a sharp corner... my car is a 2014 Jetta sport...I think die if I crash in it... I stand the thought of not dying all the way. Or just being brain dead. I just take 25 mgs promethazine, 30 mgs Cyclobenzaprine and 75 mgs vyvanse every day just to try to feel something other than the urge of dying...",1
"they say wherever someone is still thinking of you, that place is your home -jiraiya (naruto)",0
"I've come to help you. But I can't do much. Encouragement- they're all lies. I can understand how you feel because I am exactly in your shoes. If I kill myself I'm scared that I'll go to hell. So I'm stuck. But I can assure you that you are not alone. And if you want, you just got to hold on.",1
"There is always help. Please PM me, and we can talk.",1
"I bought my self kfc, no one is doing anything, or i should say i was invited to nothing. Im sorry to hear that im sure she loves you or why else would you still be living with her. if you just went over to visit im unsure why youd put your self threw that.",1
"Yep! I love watching vlogs on youtube because it feels like I have a friend with me, telling me about their day or week. I also just love background noise, and it honestly does help me feel less lonely. I think it's a pretty common thing, my dad isn't depressed either and he has to have a TV on when he is by himself or else he feels weird.",1
"In my experience, the emptiness is worse. I eventually just broke down and cried for a month and it was such a relief after years of not feeling anything.",1
"Happy birthday, you should proud that you've made it another year. I'm proud of you haha",1
Lots and lots of alcohol lmfao,0
"I keep hearing about this gym you speak of. Works, huh?",0

Let's start from the beginning. Is there anything triggering this currently that you can think of? How long have you felt this way?,0
My plan is to have enough money to start a cocaine and hookers lifestyle until I die of hepatitis C,0
Hopefully just right around the corner,1
"thanks, friend. do the same for you.",1
"Having been abandoned by close family when I was young, I guess become preconditioned to expect people to eventually always do the same. It hurts because it means I can never truly get close to people, or if I do I get too clingy making sure they never leave me. a vicious cycle.",1
Just do it. Don't think about it. Everything will be fine. &amp;#x200B;,1
Sometimes if I see a bridge or I'm high up I think I could jump and it'd all be over. Your miserable existence would cease.. but I'm too afraid to do it.. and the sad part is that I'm also too weak to live.,0
"Yep, this is pretty common. Usually when you've been depressed for a long time, it starts to become a part of your identity. I assume normal people feel a range of unpredictable emotions throughout the day, but the state of depression is pretty unchanging and there's a comfort that comes from feeling sad/numb/apathetic all day/week/month. I used to fight my depression and look for things to make me happy...when I realized it was all meaningless, I gave into my depression and it's now my closest friend. As sick as it sounds, I wouldn't want to lose it.",1
"What is it about telling a friend about your struggles with depression that makes you feel like they will react adversely? If they are a trusted friend, they will care and listen to you and be supportive of you. The benefits to discussing this with a trusted friend is they can help you get the help you need and be there for you in the ups and downs. Everyone has had depression, just for some it can be more severe, longer, and more disruptive to one's life. Try to get them to relate by asking about their moments of depression. A good way to discuss this with them is in a quiet place over coffee or food. All the best to you.",1
Huh. Good to think about.,0
Have you been smoking since long?,0
"If they work or they give you side effects, then you can try something else. You always have a say in what you take, and can always say no or tell your doctor what side effects concern you the most and they will work with you on what medications to try based on that. If your doctor one you feel you can talk to easily, maybe try a different one. great that taking a step towards taking care of yourself. I hope it works out and you feel a bit better over time. Also, I started trying to chart my moods and that can sometimes help me reflect on if medicine is helping or not. Best of luck!",1
"Yeah, not me, dog. I overthink about worthless and easy tasks while not even thinking about demanding ones.",0
"You realize people's instagram feeds are manufactured to just show the good side of things right? People only show when they're happy or when they appear to be happy, but in reality they might be just as miserable as you. It's all fake.",1
"Hey, I know how you feel. Sometimes it's hard to handle daily responsibilities when you're depressed. Everyone fucks up dude. (A practice that is helpful albeit uncomfortable is closing my eyes and breathing, imagining the place that I dread returning to, and picturing myself sitting in there, breathing and at peace. Then I zoom out to the building and picture all the rooms filled with all the other students.. Then I zoom out and picture the exterior... I zoom out and imagine the city view, then the state, then the country, then the hemisphere, then the whole planet, suspended in the I stay there and I just watch it spin slowly. And This puts into perspective that my mistake cannot defeat me.)  I flunked out of college my freshman year and still haven't had the courage to go back, so I commend you for trying again.  And as unsolicited as this is, I gotta say I disagree with the polarizing statement that there isn't anything you can do. You can own your mistake, which you already have. You can brush yourself off and see the mistake in the context of the rest of your life (which is priceless and you are worth so much.) And you can try to do better tomorrow. You are only human. Try and keep your chin up, buddy. (edit* for clarity)",1
Did you hang out with other people? Maybe you're introverted and after being around people for so long you get so mentally drained that you just don't care anymore at that point of the day? Just a guess of course.,0
"change your diet and lifestyle. eat whole and organic, exercise daily (walk for 30 mins), get plenty of sun, spend time in nature, drink lots of water, pursue a spiritual path, get rid of toxic things and people in your life, stop doing things that damage your wellbeing (junk food, bad habits, addictions, drugs, porn, etc.), wake up &amp; go to sleep early, take cold showers (proven to help depression &amp; increase energy), try /r/nofap, do meaningful work (work you love doing), express gratitude, be thankful you're still alive on this planet, and learn to change things you can and accept the things you can't.",0

Same here. Part of why self harm is so easy to me.,1
you might find someone wholl like you enough to want you around,1
"Same, my grandpa was half a world away and to be honest, didn't really have that much of a bond with me. It made me feel less human for feeling so normal still but it caught up with me eventually. Either way, sorry about your grandpa",1

I hope it turns out better than expected ^^,1
"At the same time, pessimism can be the least realistic outlook. When I'm in a rut and I am feeling negative, I make predictions about the future that other people say are extremely unlikely to come true. Maybe that's more due to my obsessive personality but in general, realism, to me, has very little in common with pessimism.",0

"The biggest thing that has helped me is running. It sucks and I never have the motivation to do it, but I force myself to anyways. I feel a short term glow of relief after running about 2 miles. Being conscious of your thoughts and trying to interrupt negative thinking can help a lot too. The summary of what my therapist had taught me is this: Your thoughts become feelings, your feelings become attitudes, and your attitudes become behavior. You cant change any of these other than your thoughts. If you can change your thoughts, you can change the others.",1
"Unless surrounded by loving people, you The last thing you want is for your happiness to depend on others.",0
"Yup. At the age where everyone is starting careers, getting married, having kids etc. I feel left behind for sure. Then I remind myself I'm where I am because of my nihilism and general apathy for achieving the cultural standards of success.",1
"Been there... but can I give a really cool trick that might truly help? When looking for a job, try to find a new store/restaurant/place opening up. No matter what it is... It was my trick back into the work force because when a place is just opening, everyone is new and everyone is learning so all in it together, instead of walking into an established place where people already know what doing and have friends etc... anyway, what worked for me in the end. Either way, keep trying. Taking it one step at a time.. fill out applications and if you get phone calls set up interviews. If you get too anxious and go then go, but maybe one day have that little extra burst of energy and go. And if you start working and like it, ok, you can look elsewhere. So just keep pushing along.",1
I've been taking prozac for eight years. It lessens my irritability and makes me slightly more functional without altering my personality.,0

"I know how you feel. I sit here wonderingwhat's the point of trying when everything is awful and the answer is: Because of the chance that things won't be awful. There's a chance. It feels hopeless, but there IS a chance, and I'm willing to fight for it. Life outside of this feeling exists, and it is possible to get to that goal. You just need to keep fighting. I know it's not much of a help, but it's all I think I can say. If you need to talk, I'm free. I'm proud of you for making it through this much already.",1
"Sorry this is over a month old but I do hope you are feeling better. The thing about bottom is, there is only one other place to go.

"Hey, I just completed my EMT cert. Part of it we had to do an ambulance rotation and were paired with paramedics for a while. Honestly, the things that I got from my experience in EMT class and doing the ride along is that there are a lot of pretty stupid, not very competent, or physically fit people out there doing it. Im not saying that you wouldn't have to change anything, but like I guarantee that you could do it if you want to and would be better at it than some of the people out there working.",1

You're out there and improving yourself. You have the drive to get things done. Congrats and good luck,1
"Sending love and support, friend!",1
Same at the moment. But realized that the way to deal so we can truly escape the pain and emptiness is by dealing with it. We want to ignore our pain so we have to deal with it but that never works out. So deal with our problems head on and TRULY acknowledge them. Of course the hard way to go because going to hurt so much but after that process we will be free of our pain. We really escape the pain by going through it.,1
"How about going for a walk? I was never a smoker, so I can't speak from experience, but walking or exercising helped me when I had cravings (eating disorder and drug related). It made me feel better to get out of the house and enjoy the scenery of a nice park. Maybe take a book or listen to music. Take it easy, if you smoke frequently you might get out of breath quickly. Bring some water and a snack or some candy. Also picking up an easy hobby to keep your hands busy, like sketching or origami? I started folding paper cranes to keep my anxiety at bay and it really helped.",1
"Yeah, depression is paradoxical in many other ways too. It can make you hungry but unable to eat, tired but unable to sleep, feel guilty but also not give a shit, want to live but also want to die. It's confusing as fuck and very debilitating.",0
"Saw mine coming a mile away. Suffering from anxiety and depression, and life circumstances kept becoming more and more difficult. Job was going to shit and stressing me out. Money was becoming a bigger and bigger problem at home. Was getting very little sleep between stress and my son not sleeping at night. One day it became too much. Started crying and having a panic attack. Didn't stop until I drank myself to sleep. The next day I was still struggling to function due to feeling incredibly and persistently overwhelmed. That was three years ago",1

Why would you want to be depressed?,0
Yeah. I think it's considered an emergency only if you are posing an immediate threat of suicide. You must be feeling as much pain as I have felt and so I feel bad for you and hope you find a way to feel better soon. Paul,1
"Maybe you can read for your exam while in bed? Have you wondered about why that is, that you can't get out of bed, or have you just accepted it as reality? Maybe you're not feeling like getting up and showering and stuff, having to change clothes and eventually throw the pile of used clothes in the washer? I know the feeling, though can't be sure that's what you're worried about. Maybe it's about meeting people? People can be stupid, demanding and stuff. Sometimes, even friends can feel like a burden to some people. Doesn't mean they hate their friends, it just drains them to constantly have to cater to their friends to keep them. Maybe being in bed is just your favorite activity. You're addicted to it, just like people being addicted to video games. It makes you feel good to just lie there, as opposed to everything else. When you leave it, you suffer withdrawals. In that case, your best bet is to force yourself for three weeks. I know it's hard, but that's literally the only way to change it. You can get someone to help you do it, if you have friends nearby that can knock on your door and be mean to you for a few weeks. Can you tell me more about your experience lying in bed? What you feel, what your thoughts are about not lying in bed?",0

I know. I sadly do not have a good answer. as clueless as you are.,1
yes I distinctly remember being very happy until people started bullying me for being gay. the feelings of emptiness and shame closed me off from normal development and have never left despite years of therapy. this eventually turned into chronic depression and failed relationships. straight men who proudly make gay jokes as if its some disgusting or abnormal thing to be avoided and mocked while they feel open and free to express their own sexual experiences have blood on their hands.,1

"Are you putting forth the sacrifice needed to change such? Have you identified if you would sooner live a lie, or live a truth? Ask a blunt person the truth. Life is inherently a horrible experience covered up by meaningless stimulations that give the illusion of better. A bandage on the mortal wound of monotony and uselessness. How many people have you met that make you feel better? How many things in your life bring you outside the feeling of depression? For me there is nothing. I am a dirty old man, white, with red hair and bad teeth. I am despised and loathed by ninety percent of the population. People actively move out of my vicinity as if my very being is a contagion they might contract. The people who don't actively run, are despicable lunatics, selfish and narcissistic beyond redemption. wOE! Woe is me!",1
I feel like I'm walking in a pile of knee high mud,0

"I always think that other ppl have great lives when I see them at work or out wherever and I have this shitty life and I'd rather be dead. But I always pretend to be happy, it makes it easier to get through the day. I wonder how many other ppl have looked at me and thought my life must be pretty awesome....",1

"I've smoked pot about 7 times or so. First time freaked me out, made me a little paranoid. I kept trying it in small doses and never really made me feel nice, just kinda paranoid. The very last time I took it I was with 2 friends and I took like 1 big-ish hit and became paranoid, again. Unfortunately, I spent that night freaking out over my heart racing and thinking I was going to have a heart attack. This ended up developing into chronic heart anxiety. This was about 4 or so years ago and now I live with extremely, extremely bad anxiety. I thought it'd be nice using it as an escape for my depression back then but never made me feel nice, alcohol did weirdly. I would love to try weed again in a different environment to see if it would help with my depression/anxiety. I hate taking heavy meds, I would much rather use weed.",1

"Spend some time just to meditate and clear out your mind. Take a walk around town. Maybe go buy a coffee, something to distract yourself before you attempt the 'writing assignment'. Just start simple. It doesn't have to be in paragraph form or even complete sentences. Maybe bullet points will make it easier.",1
It takes a while but sometimes I get in the mood for something small or i replace my old hobbies with new ones. I gave up on my trading card hobby and went back to video games. Not just the mmo's i passively play but regular single player games. Its keeping my interest for now. Some of these games I would have never played if it wasn't for people recommending on. Basically maybe something will come up or search around for something that seems interesting.,1
A depressed mind wants to stay depressed and so strays away from awake and alertness. I find myself spending to much time doing pointless things like.,0
Because you are important! Your life matters! You shall find someone who will be understanding and there for you when you are depressed.

wrong? What makes you feel like that?,0
"pretty normal for our age bracket. The 20s are a fucking catastrophe where finding yourself and acclimatising to adulthood is concerned. A lot of people feel that way so go thinking all alone in that. 24, dropped out of my animal husbandry degree, started a science one, dropped out of my forensic science degree, had a string of jobs that never last over 5 months and as emotionally stunted as they get- trust me. On the pathetic scale up there too. But not to say you change, you have to just put in the effort, or fake it till you make it.",1
"Every time I manage to be slightly productive at work two days in a row, I crash and need ten days to recover. Socializing and going out isn't that different, it's all exhausting work.",1

Meds effect everyone differently. Call your doctor. It might be bc of the meds or maybe you'd feel this way now anyway. SSRIs for me really help with anxiety but not at all for depression. Everyone is different.,1
"Nah. Going out ain't all that great. Sure you could get fucked up and momentarily think it's awesome, then end up with an STD or a unplanned kid with someone that values drugs more than anything else.",0

"I remember one time my wife had driven home to visit family. The first thing I did when I got home was hit the bottle. I was so excited to race home and get drunk to drown my pain. About 3/4's of that bottle later, I was in such pain that I couldn't help but to tell my wife. (She knew I had problems but not to what extent.) I went to bed that night praying to God for death. Wishing so bad to die in my sleep. I wanted it so bad. I look back on that time in my life as the breaking point. The point in which I decided I was meant for more than this. I was balling my eyes out. I couldn't help but cry. My emotional pain manifested into that of physical pain. It hurt so bad. But, I have made it through that. I have achieved so much. And, I know that you can too. If you need anything, please PM me. I'll give you my cell if you want to talk. You are stronger than this worthless disease.",1

"I'm wondering if depression is affecting my memory as well. I used to be able to remember people's names pretty well, and I used to be able to retain a lot of information and remember things about people. Now I have to write everything down or I *will* forget it, and my brain becomes overloaded with information extremely quickly, so I can only take in so much. I don't know where my ability to remember helpful information about people (favorite color, birthday, etc.) even went. I'm not sure I'm even fully processing what I'm learning in school.",1

We broke up twice and nothing bad happened.She just stopped loving me.Ive dealt with isolation problems all my life and its been really hard on me..

I wish I could find someone like me.Ik the power people can have; I wish I had a person to be with. Inbox if yall want someone to chat about anything.",1
"There's absolutely no point. But that's beauty of it. You get to choose everything. Do whatever the fuck you want. Do I feel like rolling out of bed today? Maybe I can sleep in all day? Or I can slowly inch out? You have the strength to do anything but it takes time depending on how much of a deviation it is from your normalcy. It's obviously not going to come at all once. So take baby steps, and that applies to everything. Because once you get going...Objects in motion remain in motion unless acted upon by an external force. So make Monday your bitch. Fuck, make it a damn Saturday. The point is, you don't have to follow along by the universe's plan. If you don't want to, then don't do it. But all it takes is a single *want* to leave your bed. And that'll come eventually, so why delay it? You're not going to hide in your covers forever are you? Or is today the day you whip the universe into submission by just **thinking** about it?",1

I spend a lot of the time believing that people do not see me, occasionally I will do stupid things order to change this, to feel noticed for some small amount of time. I think it is quite sad that some people are insecure enough that they feel the need to hurt themselves in order to have people notice them. Now maybe it is due to them having an inflated ego but I still believe they need help as without it they may end up here, posting about how awful they feel.",1

"I did. It was about 7 months ago when I was severely depressed and he knew about it. But until one time, when he said he couldn't understand me sometimes, due to my depression because I always cry. He couldn't cope with my depression so we broke up. It was hard. It was a lonely journey, but here I am now. And now he wants to get back, but I know I deserved better. What about you?",1
"When my depression was at its worst, I was lost as to what would make me feel better. I thought about what the kid version of me would think was impressive if the adult version of me actually did it. I remembered I'd always been fascinated by the seemingly impossible idea of doing a triathlon. I signed up for an Olympic distance one (way way less than an Ironman but still seemed like an almost impossible feat for me at the time) and 6 months later, I crossed the finish line. It felt good to complete and it felt good to be healthier than I'd ever been. Being fit and healthy is going to help manage depression, (/r/eood and /r/fitness are both great places) but maybe that's not your bag. Can you think of any goal that you have now (or one you can resurrect from the past) that you KNOW you'd feel great about completing?",1

Yea. Sorry. I know how you feel. feeling very alone today.,1
"Why? I don't like girls that try too hard, that wear too much makeup, or makeup at all, and skimpy clothing. Bitchy or stuck up girls are an instant turn off. I like a girl that doesn't wear makeup or tight and skimpy clothing, still takes care of herself, but doesn't try too hard and isn't trying to show off. I don't like girls that look too attractive. But I don't get girls either. I'm tall and fit and not horribly ugly but I'm socially awkward as shit and never really talk to anyone.",0

"I remember at 8/9 years old getting scolded for forgetting to brush my teeth and in the morning thereafter I started thinking about how much adults have to remember, how much they have to do in their lives. If I couldn't remember to brush my teeth every day (and I really kept trying) how would I remember to do anything else? How would I remember to learn, be good at school, how would I remember to do all the other things I kept forgetting? How could I be anything more than terrible, like I seemed to keep being. Even when I succeeded why did I always feel like I was so useless and bad at everything the moment I didn't? Why did it seem to keep getting worse? It was such a tiny thing, so inconsequential a moment, but a demon was born in my mind that day. He's lived there ever since.",1
"Is not taking a shower common amongst us depressed folk? There are days when I skip, usually when I'm home and just don't feel like it, or on Saturday. But to go a week seems extreme.",1

The worst day of my life was during a holiday, where I fell in love with a woman and thought she love me back, sleep a second, self harm, etc. And that day was followed by the best day of my life, we kissed and become a couple :). Life is full of suprises. You can talk to me here, if you want to.",1
Not stupid!!! Everyone gets that same feeling,1
"Quote I've always hung hard into everything will be ok in the end, if it's not okay, it's not the end I understand that is a very hard thing to believe.

I drink a cup a day on Prozac and I don't think I have any issues. It's more alcohol and marijuana that may have bad effects on an anti depressant.,1

"Do you know the author Tom Robbins? He recently wrote a memoir. In it, he said Everything can change completely at any moment. This is still the best argument I know against suicide. You still have plenty of life to reap, I guarantee it. What you're going through is temporary, even if it's been a long time, even if it seems like there's no end in sight. You're going to be ok.",1
"Thanks for sharing that. I agree that telling people that they shouldn't kill themselves due to their loved ones can sometimes be futile and useless. You must be going through so much with the world being unready to accept you yet. Just know there are people who do accept you for who you are. Whether it's the friend that lives far away from you or any person that read your post and identified with your story. You, staying alive and sharing this would also do wonders for trasgenders who have trouble being accepted by their families or close ones. Depression causes us to feel helpless and unloved. Slowly finding ways to treat yourself will give you more reasons to keep going. There are transgender communities that you can also communicate with on the internet. Take care of yourself please.",1

After my therapy was over I met my first girlfriend and then, again I cried from time to time in her arms. After she broke up with me two years ago I didn't manage to cry a single time until now. I'm not so sure about it, but I guess it's all about the heart and to heal it from within and not from the surface...",1
"I always see couples and hate them. Not because I am a bad person (or maybe I am), but mostly because of why I don't have anyone. I've come to the conclusion that people are so shit on everything that they shouldn't be allowed to reproduce. Every single one I've met is always doing stuff for himself/herself. EVERYTHING people do is for personal benefit, nowadays. From the way people start approaching others to the way people break up. * Wanna get a girlfriend? BETTER FIND ONE IN TINDER!. Yeah, let's all start liking some stupid slut's photos that will help you get laid and of course it will NEVER inflate her ego to think she Pretty and successful with men, while in fact she is a nobody to everybody. * Wanna take a girl on a date? BETTER USE MY PARENTS' MONEY TO SHOW I'M A MAN!. If the best thing you have to offer to the opposite sex for them to appreciate, is money that aren't even yours (and for them to like you) why the hell are you allowed to have children? We don't any more of you ass***s running around. I understand that what I am saying might seem over-dramatic to some of you(or all of you) but let me tell you some thinks about me: I am 27, I graduated the university after studying there for 8 years because I had to work and serve my conscription to the army, I've lived(and still am) my whole life with my mother because we were too poor to have a separate house, haven't found a job since I graduated because the financial crisis has ravaged my country and I feel like I have little will and reason to live anymore. I wish something happened and people couldn't have sex for over a year. Only then would society come to the place it was supposed to be. Too many sluts and too many rich kids doing shit they want.",0

"Is there not any thing that makes you feel good? I know that it may not seem like it, but think hard about it. There has to be something in your life, big or small, that makes you feel in a good way. For me I felt like I couldn't have any good emotions. Only bad ones. I sat down one day and really thought about my life. When I'm with my friends I usually can feel good. Most of all my little brothers are what bring me true joy and happiness. I took hold of this and I try to spend time with them the best I can, and sometimes I won't because I'm in a state of self pity, but I'll realize what I'm doing and pull myself out of my bed and spend some time with them. It always helps me. I understand how you feel, but there has to be at least one thing that makes you feel in a non hurtful way. It may not come right away, but I'm sure you'll think of something if you really try hard. Best of luck.",1

"Just to say I was totally in that place at the start of last week when I went on holiday. Had a massive cry and a big old panic and then made it all worse by beating myself up with it/being all like SHOULD BE HAPPY, WHY ARE YOU NOT HAPPY. I AM ANGRY THAT I AM NOT angry just makes more sad and a nasty cycle. Know that allowed to feel how you feel, and okay to go on holiday and feel like crap. I hope things start to feel a bit better and you get some relaxing in.",1
"I have a fairly normal life but I think about killing myself on a daily basis. Nothing really engages me anymore, and it hasn't for a very long time. Maybe I've just not found something I like. More likey I feel I can't be myself for whatever reason and have to pretend to be something or somebody else to fit in. It's incredibly cliqued I know but that's how I feel. I know that eventually I will kill myself it's really just a matter of when rather then if",1
"Yeah, this feeling is a strong one. Felt it consistently for a lot of my childhood and early adulthood. The truth is that I never dealt with it constructively, or at least in a way that could help me get to the root of that feeling. Part of the reason I think you and I are on this in the first place is because we were never taught how to deal with that feeling constructively. In my case, I used constant denial and self-numbing ... At some point, I just assumed the pit was a part of me I could choose to ignore. You seem to be actively trying to experience it. You are engaging your sadness, which is objectively good for working through depression. It may not be what you might call 'conventional' but everyone does their thing a little differently :) If what you are doing no longer works for you though, it might be best to start looking for other (healthy) ways of working through that discomfort. Personally, when I feel that pit, I know what thoughts tend to follow it. Fortunately, my therapists (and my stay at hospital) helped me come up with ways to attack that pit when it hit me hard. In order to redirect those thoughts that create it, I try to reach out to anyone in my support net. It's hard because I feel like they won't give a shit, but most of the time, they do (but I often choose to ignore that reality). Or I will simply write some positive words here, on this. Reaching out to others here in positive ways is not just for others, but for my own sake as well. As you put so well, giving that pit a 'purpose'. But don't cover that feeling up. Continue to engage with it, as best as you can. It's there for a reason. Hopefully, the more you work with it, the easier it is to process and let go.",1
"Why is that depressing? You should not let the amount of followers determine how you feel, especially not to this extent. It is not a reflection of what you are worth nor how successful your life is. Even if you would get more followers, what would this solve? You would not even know who most of those people are. I also doubt that an illusion like this could provide anyone with actual happiness. And Instagram has a pretty messed up algorithm anyway, I would personally not even bother.",0
"Last year I started dating the love of my life without a single doubt in my mind. My depression resurfaced tho and I started to push her away right into another man's dick. The worst part is that you can't exactly warn them about how you're really feeling and the reason why you're pushing them away because it's hard for them to understand, potentially making everything way more complicated. I don't know enough about you but I know that my heart is fragile so I put up a wall around me to protect it. But sometimes i open up a hole in the wall and it can be pretty darned beautiful.. or disappointing. Luck, maybe?",1
"Maybe you can find a room mate or something ? Idk what type of housing you live in (e.g. apt., house, renting, etc.) but that may help cut monthly expenses in some way too if that's something you're looking for. Maybe get a pet if your housing accommodations allow it. Pets really help with loneliness and depression sometimes. People can even actually get their pets registered as official emotional assistance animals. In some cases, they will be allowed to live in certain housing areas in which pets would otherwise not be allowed. Sometimes it's easy to focus on the negative of living alone. But there are tons of good things about it as well. You just gotta look towards those as well.",0

"I think I can relate to what you're saying. I feel like a big part of my depression is loneliness. I can't make friends. I want friends but even when I put myself out there, I can't say anything. It's like my mouth is taped shut. Makes me uncomfortable so I leave. Then I feel lonely, then I try to put myself out there... the whole cycle starts again. I've tried sports clubs, and other extracurriculars. I guess I just wasn't meant to have friends.",1
"It's fucking weird. I often have to bring every ounce of willpower up to bring myself to go to a party with frends, even though I know it will be good. But once I'm there, I'm often the Life of the Party, or so I think. I had people coming up to me, greeting me by my name and telling me how much fun they had last time we had met each other. Which was a year ago. For the first and last time since. I barely remembered their faces and not a single name. So I guess I left an impression. I really like to banter, to do play on words and take words from their mouth and turn them around in a fun way. I joke and tell stories with expressive facial expressions and big gestures. I'm sarcastic, sometimes even cynical. And I joke a lot about myself, mostly in a non-flattering way. I think people like me in general, I seldomly had someone outright refuse to interact with me. But on the other hand, as soon as I come home, I feel a crushing void and I feel alone and that everything is pointless. Those feelings remain in my day-to-day life. And it starts to interfere with my work, for example. I am not one to contain my feelings in an enviroment where I spend most of my days and life in. My boss already told me once, in a pretty long phase of being really depressed, that even my collegues said that something must be seriously wrong and the have no fun working around and with me if I'm in such mood. I can be fun at work, too. I made my co-workers laugh on a lot f different occasions. But that happens in good phases. But there are very bad phases where I, at best, don't say a single word all day unless absolutly necessary and at worst, I am filled with rage the whole day and can't contain it. Last week I was as close to quitting my job as I was never before. Maybe it would be best for all.  Whatever, long story short: I think I can be really funny, too. Despite the fact I feel fucking miserable inside or do not feel anything at all.",1

The doctor can't really say for sure because science doesn't even really know how or why the drug truly works. It's just a general rule that they have to tell you is to give it at least 6 weeks or so. Not surprising at all that it has made you feel a lot better at 3 weeks, that's when it usually kicks in for me as well. And yes they are designed to build up in your system over time. So it should keep on getting better for 6 months or so (with diminishing increases over time) for it to be at full strength. But again everyone is affected a little differently.

That's terrible. I can understand the struggle they must be. This world is not sustainable for a lot of people.,1
"Depression isn't something you can get rid of by wishing it away or telling someone you have it. A lot like an addiction you have to fight to get out of it. And it's hard to tell what path is right or wrong. Talking to people does help. But you need to find someone you can talk to. I couldn't talk to my mom for the life of me, my sister would tell my mom or tell me I was wrong, my dad just gave me a look and didn't know what to say besides he cares about me. Once my mom knew the extent of my depression she became better at helping me. She listened and didn't judge. She let me talk and told didn't lecture but reassured my decisions. She went out of her way to make me feel more confident. That's the person you need to find. Also try writing your feeling down whatever you feel on a peace of paper what ever is on your mind. Write it in chicken scratch don't worry about how ty write just write what you feel. Then throw the paper away. That used to help me, not as much as my mom did but I did help. Life isn't something we can live alone although a lot of us want to, I wish I could, find someone to confide in that supports you.",1

I do function and I functioned my whole life - I have a scholarship for my study program and am one of the best in my semester plus are part of the student representatives and more stuff and having a job. So everyone would agree that I'm working very well - but that doesn't mean that it ever goes way up or that I am close to anything like happiness - or that I ever was. So I can't agree with you. That people expect you to function just puts more pressure on you - it's not helpful.,0

I have dreams all the time about my little sisters getting hurt, and it makes me worry for them. just today I had some kind of sleep paralysis (I don't know if that's the right word, I looked it up but it didn't seem to fit) and honestly I'm scared to fall asleep tonight because I do not want it to happen again. it's happened several times and it terrifies me. you're not alone, friend.",1

I feel the same way. Do you want to talk about it?,1
"Mirtazapine as far as I know is used for depression/insomnia typically. Not for adhd. I would ask your doctor about vyvance or another drug similar to that for your adhd... mirtazapine is perfectly fine to go from that dose to 30 in my opinion. It would be better if your body was introduced longer to the 15mg (2weeks) then bumped up to 30mg, but I see no complications or issues with being bumped up to 30mg this early in the game. Side effects of Mirtazapine are that it will make you tired, so the motivation and everything may be an issue with your adhd... Again look into vyvance. You may gain some weight also, that is a common side effect. Also some anxiety could occur, but that is rare. important to read up on your meds when you receive new ones. Or ask your doctor before you even get prescribed them.",0

"I feel like it's a paradox. People would call you or I selfish, but who are they to assign life or the absence thereof. Many people can't relate to such feelings of loneliness and unworth. But for those who can, being called selfish for suicidal thoughts, makes it all the more confusing of a situation. It also shows you who really cares, cause calling you selfish is just choosing the victim route, for themselves, which is fucked. While some may call it manipulation. Whatever the name, it's hardly sympathetic, and isnt even close to empathetic. Which, empathy, is what this world is lacking. A partnership society would support each other regardless of their stance or tradition. But, we live in a male dominated, monotheistic world. People suck. The only thing we can do is help them. So that's why I think suicide is hard; you're not helping anyone.",0
"I tend to go back to sleep over and over, and I eat at dinner time. spend the nights playing video games and then I oversleep. I need a balance of alone time and time with friends to start feeling like myself again, and if I get that balance wrong I can meltdown. I tend to downplay my problems to the people around me and upplay them to strangers. For example, inflate things for the sake of a conversation with some crisis volunteer or something, just to get some free sympathy and support that I have to feel weird about later because I see that person again. But, if a friend asks me how doing, my first reaction is to reply I have good friends so they call me out on this. I self sabotage by missing appointments or shutting out natural light. If cold, thirsty, hungry or uncomfortable, I ignore it and let myself suffer. I know getting better when I start doing certain things for myself. If I make myself some tea or get more blankets or sit somewhere other than my bed, I tell myself because I care about myself and want to feel better. I have physical pain associated with depression, usually I feel an ache in my arms and legs. When I have the energy I stretch to alleviate it. This also helps me feel better. I have to be conscious of whether I have the energy to do something, because if I force myself I could get overwhelmed and just sink further down. had to learn to say no to people when what they ask of me is more than I can provide without suffering later. But, for the most part, learned my depression will leave when good and ready. been going downhill for two months and had a meltdown a few nights ago so been thinking a lot about what I really need to get through these times. These depressed phases tend to last 4-6 months for me so still got a long way to go. This my first rodeo, though, prepared. learned that there are plenty of little things I can do that feel like self care. Self care is not always an elaborate bath with essential oils and red wine. To me self care is getting up to make a cup of tea, spending a couple minutes stretching, or ordering food when hungry instead of waiting until everything is closed and starving. It have to make you feel better all at once, but all those little things add up, and it means more when you put conscious value on it. will stretch so my body hurt so much, and I do this because I care about feeling I say to myself. I meant for this to be short...... and then it Hang in there.",1

"I ran away two times as a teenager. One time I was gone for a couple of months. I only went back when I became physically ill and couldn't afford meds. I begged my parents to let me come home and buy my prescriptions. I had a terrible UTI and bladder infection. Going back home was terrible and good at the same time. I was sad to be home, my parents were angry with me and told me all the terrible things they believed about me while I was gone. Things they heard from other people and things I think they imagined. About 80% were completely untrue. I was a disappointment and a sinner. I was sad to be away from my boyfriend and glad to be away from him at the same time. He was considerably older than I and of course I had envisioned our life together as different. The second time I ran away I had a better plan partly. I took my clothes and anything else I could throw in my friends car and went to her house where she lived with her grandparents. The next morning I woke up to my Step Mom standing at my feet telling me to get up and come with her and Dad. I grew up very depressed, my Mother passed away when I was 2 1/2 years old, then my older sister passed away few years later. Every day I was sad. I didn't understand what happened, I didn't understand how something so terrible could happen and life changed drastically and in a flash. No one talked to me about any of it and I was broken. Walking to school in the morning, thru classes all day, walking home in the afternoon, having dinner, staring into the void during homework time, staring at the ceiling at night trying to go to sleep, I had a huge pain in my chest and I was alone.",1

"Shit, my dude, other people will always have worse (or better) lives than us. That doesn't invalidate your pain. I look at it like this: As a kid, I would throw tantrums in the grocery store if my mom wouldn't buy my favourite cereal. A couple years later, I could handle that, but I cried when I got cut from the basketball team. A couple years after that, I was nearly suicidal when my girlfriend dumped me. I eventually learned to handle rejection, but full time work drove me to drug abuse. Now, I can handle working 50 hours a week. The point is I have always had terrible coping skills. None of my problems have ever been that bad, but they have been the biggest problem I ever faced. They always seem overwhelming because I don't know how to handle failure of rejection of really any kind of pain or even mild discomfort. I am a wimp. And yet, they still treated me at the hospital - multiple times. I was never told to suck it up; I was taken seriously and given the help I need. It isn't about the external circumstances, it's about how we react to them. So if you need help, *that's okay*. You aren't any less of a person. You are worth just as much as anyone else. Someone losing their home or family in Texas doesn't mean your problems are irrelevant at all!",1
Being alone is difficult. Honestly it helps to reach out. I reconnected with an old friend. We hadn't been in touch for couple years over a petty argument and a bad experience being roommates. Anyone in your life you could reach out to?,1
"Here's the simplest way I can think of: 1- Go to your primary care doctor and report your symptoms of depression. Ask to be referred to a psychiatrist. If you can immediately see a psychiatrist, go for that. 2- Get into therapy, it really helps. Use psychology today to find good caregivers in your area. It really helps. I'm assuming you're living in the U.S., but regardless, I wish you the best of luck.",1

I went through the same thing trying to tell my doctor something was wrong. It turned out he asked me. Sometimes they'll ask a generic have you been feeling down or helpless, have you had any suicidal thoughts etc. I think they're getting better at making it easier to talk about. It's worth a shot. Good luck.",1
"hey, do you need someone to talk to?",1
"I get it too. I slept in 3 nights, my mind is ablaze! having a really tough week too in my struggle with depression, but before this week, I had three really good weeks. Hang in there!

Just take it one day at a time and know that you are not alone! I hope tomorrow is a good day!",1
Everything is wrong with people.,0
When you're alone do you find that you can be content while also taking care of yourself or do you start to feel like you're slipping and increasingly become overwhelmed and unable to do daily things to take care of yourself? Sometimes it can be hard to understand what's going on inside and it helps to watch what you start doing/stop doing instead.,0
"Let others suffer with you. The biggest struggle with depression is the isolation box it confines us in. It fools us into believing there is no one that will understand. Tells us not to burden others with our problems. Demands we keep our pain in the shadows. But this is the nasty cycle that keeps us locked in to our loneliness. We feel lonely, hate that we feel lonely, feel stupid for looking weak, and decide to keep it hidden. We find worth in our connection to others. Not because they decide if we are worthy or not, but simply because our ability to contribute what is in us is only useful in light of others. I'm not sure of your circumstances, but I can tell you that I have been in your shoes. I have felt completely cut off from the world. I have laid in bed night after night, wondering why I should even be here. I have been so lost and hard on myself that I couldn't even look at my face in the mirror. I have broken down in just about every room of the places I lived and expected it to never change. But it did. Not all at once. It took time. But when I began to open up to others and let them struggle with me and offer help. And by also helping others myself. It doesn't need to be family or current friends. Finding support is a hard thing these days. But there are great places now to get help working through the pain of living.",1

I think that avoiding work to sit at home in your misery is a bad thing. Getting out of the house is recommended even if it's something like going to work. Obviously do whatever you feel is best but I don't think skipping work is going to help you get any better. For example I could barely get out of bed this morning to go to work but even though I'm here hating it I would alternatively be at home sleeping until 2pm then lay in bed on my phone all day.,1

"It is unfair. Modern psychology/psychiatry is completely incapable of helping those who are in severe pain with lifelong battles with mental illness. It often feels like we are just vehicles of pain who live so that others don't suffer from grief should we commit suicide. As we develop a greater sensitivity to the cost of mental illness, policies and social norms will change: Some countries now allow for euthanasia for those with chronic and unbearable mental illness. But what's strange about all of this is, even though I'm certain I have the right to kill myself because I'm miserable everyday, I am pulling for you to live, even though you're a stranger on the internet. I have hope for you and I don't even know you. I want you to wait it out, to battle it out, not because you owe me or anyone else, but because I think there might be something better for you in a day or a week or a decade from now. What have you tried so far to get some relief? Has anything worked? What can you do that brings you moments of enjoyment?",1
This is the sentence I fear the most. It's why I've never reached out to anyone.,1

"As someone said here previously, depression doesn't care who you are, where you are from, what you have or don't have. Even if you don't have serious problems, depression makes you feel like you're carrying all the problems of the world.

"I find that how you view failure is tied to your expectations quite heavily. Or also the pressure of feeling others' expectations of you on your shoulders. I still haven't worked things out that I'm able to effectively handle failure myself, but mainly people can feel better when they fail, because they recognise it as a learning experience, or it is an inevitable part of the process. Now this may sound obvious, but when in the moment, it is very easy to forget this and lose sight of progress after the failure. Failure can appear in many forms. My expectation of a 'good outcome', instead was a horrible mistake... Or was it? I'm sorry to hear you feeling even worse after your suicide attempt. Just know that I believe you are alive, and fighting, and you will come out of this stronger.",1

I'm jealous of you artists.. I play guitar and I've gotten to the point where I can usually play how I feel but it makes me feel worse normally...the same sad chords and melodies. Do you have any art you'd like to share? I'd love to see some,1
"You never get over depression it is a daily struggle, but it brings to mind a Bojack Horseman quote: it get a easier but you have to do it everyday. That's the hard part. I've dealt with suicidal ideation for 2 decades, you never really get rid of those thoughts. We are essentially biological computers subject to our programming. We can't delete the program we've learned of suicidal ideation, but we can learn how to combat it, but it is a battle we must be ready to confront everyday. You are blind to your weaknesses but you are equally blind to your strengths. You aren't alone. Don't take your life. You aren't an isolated dust mote among 7 billion other dust notes. You are a node in a network, and the things you do and you don't do are far more important than you think. I wish you the best, and hope you see the power you truly have.",1
"I do. *Kind of.* Let's not mix clynical depression and negative emotions together, they are totally different things. I realize that I'm stuck with the first type. I'm seeing the therapist, taking the medication and blah-blah-blah. Moreover, I can't say that I'm often in the teary mood. It usually feels like I'm tired of e v e r y t h i n g. However, sometimes it's bigger than me. Sometimes I want, no, there's a **NEED** for me to feel miserable. I want people to turn back on me, so I could only feel worse. That's why sometimes I fake the feelings and try to provoke others. I'm lost, *ha haha ha*",1
in what way do people bother you. Like they personally go out of their way or you mean like everyone including random people annoy you?,0
"You say you'll never be able to move out . . . sure you will! would you be moving to a new city or some where farther away? obviously, to move out, you will need a good paying job and money for an apt (by your self or with roommates.) tell your family that you are moving out on X date, if you are over 18, they can't really do anything about it. tell the police that you are moving away and your family is triggering your depression. they might try to file a missing person report if they notice that you go missing out of no where. suicide, I don't think, is ever the answer.",0

"I joined here about 5 days ago, because I feel so close to the people here. like my family in a way. I know that sounds weird, but my point. I have depression, and feel alone as well. I feel like what I say matter, and no one listens to me. I do my best in something, and all I get in return is absolute shit! It pisses me off. I feel different as well, like not in the same league as everyone else. a quiet person, and am pretty shy around girls because not sure what they think of me. I think what you need is some independence :) It will make you happy, because that way not around people. I know it seems ironic because then be even more alone, but just pay attention to anyone. Be your own boss, and think of everyone else as just empty space. Think as is it matter what they say. Be a shield. let anyone get in your way. here on Earth, be here for a reason. The reason you feel lonely is because of people. Think about it.",1

"Well done, you've shattered the illusion :) But where are you trying to make it? Where are you going? Sometimes we all have to fake the way we are in order to get where we need to be, or get to what we want. But other times, all that effort is so dragged on and futile because we are working to satisfy some expectation. Then at the end of the day, satisfying the expectation is underwhelming--dissatisfying to its core. Then we just think, ok, now what? Just this post is poetic enough to make me think that you've got some fancy talents locked up in that head of yours. I wish you luck my friend, I bet you can make something of yourself, even if you struggle to believe it. And chances are, you've probably already done some neat things, and I hope you've taken the time to appreciate these accomplishments. I'm wishing you fantastic luck.",1

"I can agree with every single thing you have listed there, and experience them all. It is not normal for a 24 year old good looking, well educated man to be feeling this way - but I have never felt right in life. The biggest thing that kills me is that I have never experienced a relationship or genuine friendship in my life. I find myself completely and utterly alone every day. My only communication is with my clients by email. I do leave the house, but it's only to go to the grocery store or for a walk - by myself of course. I read on the internet about all these wonderful holiday destinations that i'd love to visit, but I can barely afford it and going by myself is not enticing at all. Just sick of it..",1

Yes I do. And the weight gain just makes me sink into further depression.,1
"Just stop brother. Just stop. You have a purpose, find it.",0
this is really really good. shows you're slowly dealing with your feelings or at least learning to tolerate them.,1

You won't find the answer you're looking for here. Use google.,0
Is it an alarm problem or a I don't want to go so I just go back to sleep because fuck it what's the point in going problem? Most campuses offer free counseling so if you're concerned that this is a personal issue I would check that out.,0
"Getting rid of depression gets rid of loneliness. I got depressed when I had a loving wife, good job, and many friends. After a decade of that I had no wife and few friends. I got medical help and five days after leaving treatment I have 5 new friends, am on speaking terms with a bunch of my neighbours I've never spoken to before and have hope. I have become outgoing and gregarious. Never would have believed that one. _effed_up",1
"I'm sorry. I've been in and out of a relationship for years now. She's loving and considerate and great in so many ways.. but there's no commitment. Actually the space between us has grown over the years. I guess part of it is that I'm a bit of a basket case and it can be emotionally taxing. I don't even want to put her through all of that for the rest of her life. But at the end of the day I just want to go home and share my life with her.. and she's not there. She's done so much for me but it makes me feel so unwanted that this is the end of the line. Like I'm just a burden and despite all the love she has to offer, I'm just too screwed up for it to work. I feel so lonely and so stupid for everything I've done to turn her away.",1

Well now people want photographic evidence :[ You probably look fine though,1
So sorry you are going through this. My mom died when I was 21. It's a traumatizing experience. I hope you have a supportive family. My family was only my mom and sisters at that time. Don't kill your self; your dad would not want that. Get help even if you don't feel like living right now. It does get better.,1
That would honestly be the best thing ever,0
All I can provide for you is the cliche reply telling you that there is much more to life than struggling and that it can change if you try to. But non of this might affect you. You yourself have control of your own life and what you do with it. All I can say is that you might be making a really regrettable decision as you only have one life to live and enjoy to a degree. You only get one chance to feel anything if nothing and that is more than an incentive for most to keep going.,0
"Yeah pretty fucking horrible but not unforgivable. But your mental illness is no excuse. We are obligated to do our best every day to be good people, just like everyone else. THAT BEING SAID, what would you tell someone else who posted this? Hopefully that not the only person to make this mistake, and making mistakes make you a bad guy. The fact that you feel remorse shows that you have empathy and care about others.",1
"Yeah, mostly in the chest area. It can be really painful if extremely depressed.",1
"I feel the same and i think its because i have nobody to talk to, nobody to be vulnerable to and let them know how i feel inside. Why dont you try to talk to your girlfriend, i bet if she'd new she'd try to help. Open up to her! Hope it goes well :)",1

"I feel you my friend.. Things used to be so simple, right? My memories of happiness and the person I used to be are what keeps me going when I feel things are so heavy. Like, I know I have been happy and therefore I know it's a possible state to be in and surely I can attain that state again, somehow. But things used to be so simple. They are not anymore. If you haven't already I urge you to seek out a psychologist or therapist. The hard part is taking contact and telling them what's up, the rest is the easy part - even if it takes time.",1
"There isn't a lot I can say or do that will really help you at this point in time. If you are feeling this low in your life that you want to die nothing I nor anyone else can say to change your mind but I will try my best to do what I can. There are people around you who can help you. Hospitals, doctors, therapist and counsellors. Over 20% of the worlds population deal with mental illness and seeing another person give in would be heartbreaking. Sadness is a passing feeling but depression is long term however it is recoverable. Things might be horrible right now but I promise you if you reach out and get help you can do this. You can get pass this difficult stage and these feelings will eventually leave. But perhaps you've already tried to get help and it hasn't worked. If so, thats ok. Therapy doesn't work for everyone but we can find a way to help you get out of this state so please before picking up that gun think of everything you will be leaving behind. Right now it may feel like you're alone and no one cares, but you won't know what truly will happen if you're dead. You won't be able to see people you love anymore, hear sounds of music or voices, see colours and people around you. A life you could have lived. You will be in an internal slumber, this is not a temporary way of dealing with this so please think this over. You can message me. I might not know how you are feeling right now but I will definitely be a person to listen and try to understand. I believe in you.",1
At least it's something. Would you rather have them pity you or not give a shit? I feel alone with everyone I'm around. I think it'd be worse knowing I'm truly alone. Embrace it because they love you regardless how you are as a person. (How's that for not wanting to be pitied? ;) ),1
That's why I'm repeating 11th grade. It sucks.,1
I know how it feels man. It sucks. terrible to hear and sorry :(,1
"I'm in a really depressed mood right now, which caused me to say it doesn't. But if you're losing motivation right now, there are many many ways to feel better that I'm guessing you haven't tried. And I think these things are individual, so it's hard to find the certain things, but I know you can do it. And maybe try a different counsellor if they aren't the best fit. How's your diet? How are you doing socially? So never lose hope.",1

"I don't really use the tv, but I do usually have a youtube video playing on the background when I'm by the computer. I could be browsing random websites or trying to do some crafting etc, but I need the distraction of the videos. Also if I'm watching a movie or tv show I often have to do something else at the same time - solitaire, browse a magazine, read an article. I know I can concentrate just on one thing at a time, but there's something about too much quiet bringing bad thoughts to the surface.",1
"Mostly video games, keeps my negative thoughts away pretty well. Music I try to avoid because when I'm in those kind of hard times I tend to listen to music that I can relate to so it kind of brings more of the feelings to the surface. Memes are funny I guess. Masturbation is short term. Yeah video games.",1
I'm sure you will see your way through. Just don't do what I did. Don't rush I to a relationship and don't have your head in the clouds thinking that its going to be heaven on earth. Don't be blinded from your emotions and always pay attention to reality.,1
Preaching to the choir man. I feel yeah. Try to enjoy everyday. I know it can be hard.,1
"Wait, does this mean you're seeing someone already? I can see the concern, but if you're already suffering then not doing anything at all for you isn't really better. You can always look for a second opinion. I'm getting help, but before I was (and while I was trying to find the right combo of things), I'd have both depression and anhedonia at the same time pretty frequently. Like, 4-5 days out of a week. It sucked hard. Right now my anxiety is the bigger problem most of the time, but anhedonia still strikes and lasts like maybe a day to almost a week. Sometimes I make myself go do something outside of the house to distract myself, even if it's not actually enjoyable. This combo sucks, and I hope you find a way to lessen or even break the pattern.",1
"&gt; These feelings of anxiety and depression will never leave. I feel the same way. It's hard too because when someone does believe in you, you can't even tell anymore. Maybe you think it's because they just want to be nice or maybe it's because of other reasons, idk. Just don't keep fighting. If the life you're living isn't making you happy, it's not what you want, why don't you change it? I'm not saying it's easy, or that you even can.

Why did you want to commit suicide?,0

with you. For me it matter what it is.. just as long as it stops the thoughts.,1

"What is your consciousness worth to you? That's what should matter most. What good can you do with your mind and what's getting in your way. Don't weigh the bad against the good and make a judgement, fight to keep the good alive for as long as you can. You life is once in a lifetime. You're lucky to be alive and to be human. For most people, things can usually get a lot worse. If your problems stem from your sense of worth, don't let someone else determine your value. How much is life worth? Probably worth more than anything in existence, it can't be bought.",0

Hey buddy you are not alone. I spent a day where I literally didn't so much as sit up in bed a couple of weeks ago. Didn't eat or drink anything so I didn't need the bathroom which was good.

yes. lofe is shit. i walk around my home hours on end just like you. nothing i do can save me from suffering. All cause i am ugly smelly balding indian midget.,1

"I can tell you this much: If you can tell whether or not the medication is making a positive difference, then I'd say that it's worth enduring the negative side effects. As a side note, I feel like I've heard of/known people who eventually weened themselves off of their meds and ended up not needing them, but it's probably different from person to person. I have no idea what the future holds for you, and there's probably no definitive way to predict how things will end up for you and your medication, so good luck.",1
"Hey. I understand what you are feeling, and I am so sorry you are experiencing this. :( really such a hopeless feeling. Please feel free to PM me if you would like to talk. About anything.",1
Are you on any medications? This can actually be a side effect of certain meds.,0
"I have been at a similar point to you where I had suicidal ideations on a daily basis and to be honest, even when aspects in my life have improved, I still struggle with it frequently. I have done many things in life I regret and feel like I've fucked up a lot of situations, relationships and opportunities in both my personal and professional life. It took me a long time to understand that I can't go back in time and fix anything. It is fucking terrifying to feel like you've messed your life up but please trust me when I say that it's ok to fuck up. You are human. We all are. I have found that being alone with my thoughts was a big factor in triggering urges to harm myself or get stuck in my thought loops about how useless or worthless I am. If you have someone you trust to talk to, please dont be afraid to rant or reach out to them. My inbox is always open too if you need a stranger to listen. You're not alone in this.",1

(Is medical marijuana legal where you live, or if not is it a possibility to move to where it is?) You might find support and recommendations at r/sciatica Hang in there. I would strongly recommend trying to talk to a therapist if that's an option.

"Nah man, What you're saying is actually quite common of someone who is good at art. Most people with a high degree or artistic talent are really good at *recognizing* good art, but get frustrated because their own art doesn't live up to the crazy high standard they've set for themselves. Malcom Gladwell suggests that it takes 10,000 hours to gain mastery in something. Art is a skill just like anything else. I think a lot of people get fooled into this You either have it or you don't mentality when it comes to creative arts. It's just not the case.

No friends or family, who are trying to cheer me up. Just me, work and my depressed thoughts that are preventing me to fall asleep every night. I am so lonely, it feels like deep cuts into my heart. I want to end this fucking pain.",1

"People always tell me ''it could be worse''. It could be worse? No, it really couldn't be much worse. This is a disease of the brain - the part that makes out the very essence of our self, the part that tells us about the world around us, that allows us to draw conclusions about the world, have morality and feel everything from the love poets have written about since the advent of letters to the soul crushing despair ahead of the final override of our animal nature: suicide. If you can't rely on that, you are fucked. If you suddenly can't feel some emotions anymore, you're fucked. If you no longer feel the moral qualms that have guided you for years, you're fucked. Please tell me what is worse than only being able to use a computer to interact with your environment and that computer being broken in a way we don't understand? Just that it is worse than that, because there is no you. You are the computer and your network card is fried, your CPU has a tear and your battery no longer holds charge...and there's nothing that can be done. All you can do is grit your teeth and keep going. Try to adjust to the fact your version of reality is not actually real and that information you are getting about your body is downright not true - apart from when it is, because if your brain believes you have no energy, you sure as fuck have no energy. Try to not let the lack of love and happiness and the very concept of hope throw you into that pit of despair. Now, pray tell me, what precisely could be worse? I'd rather be hungry with a broken arm, because then I would still know that it is me who is hungry and that my arm hurts. I could still believe that may be tomorrow there will be food. I would feel the natural drive of self preservation to bandage that arm. You have no concept of what a malfunctioning brain means and I hope that you never will, but please do not compare it with other experiences, because there is nothing like it short of hypoxia at the summit of Mt. Everest - there you are starving the brain of oxygen and get an impression of it slowly shutting down. People pay a lot of money so they can have the experience and know they pushed through within the day it takes them to do the last stage. I am trapped there. Every day of my life. I can't descend. Ask someone who went up the mountain if there is anything worse. Just that I'm also walking into school/work each day. I do chores. I get dressed. I pay bills. While just wanting to lie down and give up so bad.",1
"Supplements: --- Fish oil: There is some evidence that fish oil with 2 EPA to 1 DHA ratio helps with depression. Helps me a bit but maybe placebo effect. 5-HTP: Tried while really depressed/anxious and it didn't help. SSRIs didn't either and only a long acting Benzo did anything beneficial. Might try again later. Valerian root: Calms some people down. Doesn't do much for me. Rhodiola Rosea: Apparently gives you more energy while keeping you calm. Maybe a bit more energy for me but could be placebo effect. St. John's Wart: Supposed to be a natural antidepressant. I am thinking of trying it soon. Magnesium: Helps some people (assuming deficiency exists) but I have not tried it yet. Alcohol: Works great to calm social anxiety in a moment! Don't consume if taking prescription drugs. Consume in moderation if you need to drive home. Marijuana: Can really elevate mood, depends on the person. Can be combined with alcohol for added effect. Don't drive at all after using it. Don't use if illegal where you live or your employer drug tests. --- Lifestyle: --- Exercise: Some people rave that being active reduces anxiety and depression. In my case the gym is actually a trigger. I do enjoy going for a walk on a nice day though. Diet: I have started eating better and less. I have lost substantial weight and feel physically better. The sense of accomplishment and feeling better about my body has probably helped my depression. Travel: If you can afford it take a vacation and go see the world. Go alone so that you can discover your true self and not be at the whim of another person. It was an extremely positive experience for me. ---",1

"What was the end result of the conversation you had with them? Was everyone impacted there? Was there an explicit apology and acceptance of that apology? When you say that you think things are cool now, what are you basing that off of? Some guilt never goes away, even if the impact of the action does.",0
"Do you have any friends that aren't always going to blow sunshine up your ass or a therapist? That you can talk to about how you feel that she treats you and get like... An unbiased opinion? You've mentioned elsewhere here that you may have been over reacting. I know that I struggle with recognizing when I'm justifiably upset vs letting my depression's self hate mode move on to the other things I care about. Being depressed should be proof enough in itself that feelings can't always be trusted, or listened to, or followed, even if they're obviously there.",0
"About 18 months back, I made a post after cutting ties with some of my closest friends, saying, There is only family, and before that I was posting tons of dark poetry and misanthropic musings.

Everyone is unique and doesn't live the same life or the same way! As for how to stop feeling that way, it really depends. Maybe talking about the reasons you feel that way would help? Perhaps trying to try new things and find that thing that makes you feel important, proud, happy, successful, etc. could help. Regardless I hope you are able to see the part of you that is already there that is special OP. Message me if you ever wanna talk more about it, I struggle with it often as well.",1
"I've had a similar realization recently, but my reaction is a bit different. I've decided to try my past to fight against these thoughts and problems to find ways to be happy sometimes. I have bad social anxiety and have started trying medication and meditation. Honestly it often feels harder than just giving into the depression. Forcing myself to go places that could make me feel uncomfortable because of too many people. Taking classes where I learn something completely new. But maybe in the end I'll be glad I've done these things.",1

i would recommend you check out r/suicidewatch,0
"You may feel shitty when you get back, but FWIW, the walk is still good for you. It's a little exercise, maybe a little sun (depending on the weather and where you live), and it's something that feels good for you in the moment. May not be much, but I've always found it's important to recognize the little tiny positives like these. So good for you, take those walks when you can and remember it's a small way to take care of yourself and your mental health. Bike rides are awesome too.",0

I love you all. Genuinely the replies here made me feel much less alone. your kindness is beautiful,1
"The cure is less stress and ways to de-stress. Then your brain will start operating better. Why? Because you don't have energy, focus, clear thoughts, motivation and thousand other things precisely because of too much stress that got out of hand and you can't handle it anymore. I'll give you one example. Do you know what happens when there is too much cortisol? Look up high cortisol symptoms. So to unravel these symptoms is to only go in reverse, by finding ways to constructively de-stress.",0
"Ditto. Been hyper depressed this past week. Having an absolute fuck of a time getting myself to do simple things. Like eat. Or get up. Life looks pretty bleak and it's all my fault.

Funny thing, my supervisor almost cried today at work and was complaining in a high pitched voice xD. It kinda brightened my day LOL.",1

"Hey, I feel the same way. quite demoralizing to see everyone in a relationship when all you want at times. Most of my friends are in committed relationships. So, been times where I was the only single guy in the room. I say anything, but deep down it kind of hurts. I help but think I just I realize that not something I could say to anyone else. I could never look at anyone call them unlovable. So why can I say it myself? Why do we think such nasty thoughts about ourselves? My friend, you do deserve love, and I hope that it comes to you. :) Oh, and social media is terrible for this type of feeling btw. been staying off Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat lately. I now feel a lot more secure in my status as not constantly bombarded with pictures of happy couples (who are also usually just posing for the picture, sometimes they break up the next day).",1

If you feel like you are in over your talk to your teacher/professor and tell them struggling to handle the assignments. talk to your school/university about dropping your math class. see a counselor or psychologist at your school/university and see if you qualify for accommodations through student accessibility/disability services.,0
Absolutely. Where I live I can be killed peacefully in a hospital if I have a terminal physical disease such as cancer. Depression/Anxiety is also terminal...it kills slower but it is just as painful in different ways.,1
Whats going on why do you think things would be better without you or why does it make you feel better to think that you will not be around anymore?,0
Definitely anxiety related for me. usually okay but had a stressful night a few nights ago and just felt nauseous since. Gets really bad when just laying in bed to the point where I sleep cause I think gonna throw up hoping it passes soon,1
Do you have anyone you can call?,0
Yeah. I say I'm okay because getting help is scary and difficult.,1

Tbh. I used to hate being sensitive. But I love it now. And people need to be considerate of it! really a strength. Being sensitive makes your more empathetic (which is an amazing fucking quality to have!) and just really more in tune with the mood of the room. Do you know there are some people that just babble on and even ever tell that other stopped listening?? I know it sucks overthinking and constantly worrying. But being sensitive makes you a better human.,1
"Same here, Mondays even lead to me hating Sundays afternoon/evenings because since I'm in school Sunday is just supposed to be a workday to prepare for Monday. I usually wake up late on the weekends and never get anything done like I'm supposed to, so Mondays usually are stressful for me.",1

It really boils my blood when people do that. my mother tried to commit suicide and was in the hospital for a few days. My sister and uncle were just talking shit...ugh made me feel pretty furious. My mother has battled depression for sadly the great majority of her life. I cannot begin to understand her mental anguish yet it infuriates when I hear people talk shit about an already vulnerable person.,1
Listen to music full blast and cry for a bit.,1
I feel the exact same way. My ex girl friend broke up with me and got pregnant with another guy . Words can't describe what I went through. Atleast your not buying hard drugs right ? If you are I'm not judging you.,1
"I feel the same. For years of isolation, now I don't know if I ever will find someone to love me, talk to me.",1
Buddhism would fit your life views and might help you with depression. Look into it. It's aimed at eliminating the suffering thing and moving towards constant unconditional satisfaction with life. P.S.: I promote Buddhism so much I might come across as sectarian lol.,0

No need to explain. I know exactly what you mean. I'm tired too.,1
Not really.... some of them do. And those people will end up not doing much with thier lives. Do you have any passions? what are you doing with schooling? Work towards earning a fuck tonne of money so that you have power and money when you are older.,0
"I know this feeling all too well. The last six months for me have been the absolute worst in many many different ways. You don't get healed -- ever -- but you get something better if you can just force yourself to ride it out. What you're feeling now gets compressed and you're able to focus and use it to enact whatever changes you need in your life. One thing I feel like you really need to hear is that you deserve better, a lot better than what you've been getting. You're not worthless, you don't have to settle, you should be treated better, you should own a big piece of this world instead of being crushed by it.",1
Hope you start feeling better and life gets less awful,1
"No, depression isn't a choice. You can't control it.",1
"A friend of my mine gave me a stupid novelty soda a few months ago. He was moving, and he told me he'd thought it'd make me chuckle once or twice. It did. I thought it was funny, and I appreciated that he had thought of me instead of just throwing it away. He hasn't talked to me in a month. I see it on a table in my room every day and I'm hit by how much I am going to miss him. How much I do miss him. I'm going to put the bottle in his car tomorrow. I'm tired of crying over him.",1
in that case i'm a cold mess.,1
Abilify caused akathisia which is a severe form of restless leg. I was close to chopping off my legs...,1
"Yes. I'm going through this exact scenario right now. It's causing me to question my entire reality with him. It's such an earth shattering feeling. Like, what else can I not trust in my world? The worst part was that in my gut, I knew it. I've known it for longer than I've wanted to admit. I just hoped I was wrong and let myself get sucked in even further. I believed all the bullshit just because maybe he meant it when he told me he loved me. He didn't mean it. I can't comprehend doing that to someone I loved. So I totally understand how you feel. I'm here if you want to talk.",1
I remember this one! Keep fighting!,1

Yes hunny what you need?,1
"Don't say it does get better. You don't know. You don't know his life, you don't know his past, his environment, nothing, how in the world could you make a statement that yes, rejoice, his life WILL undoubtedly get better? That's a very corrosive statement to make which DOES NOT HELP the person you're telling it to. For OP. Could you maybe find a reason to live in the fact that if you get out of this abusive life you're living in and build a life that you're proud of, that will show your family how better of a person you are than them? Would you find comfort and maybe willpower in that?",0
"I sometimes have thoughts like that, but I would never kill myself. P.S. Just a tip, be careful about writing such stuff on the internet. Lots of asshole white knights out there that will call the cops on you to protect you from yourself, even if you aren't actually suicidal. If you think your life is bad, imagine your life on forced medication and in psychiatry with lots of assholes telling you what to do all day and treating you like a child. Don't trust people on the internet.",1
"What DO you love? Is there something you are passionate about? Something (other than another person, as people are inconstant and often unreliable) that you are passionate about? Self destruction takes a lot of energy. If you can refocus it on creation (of almost anything other than say, slashes on your wrists) it might help you. This is how I have found peace. When I feel the monster stirring I write it poetry and kiss it goodnight. I hope the best for you.",1
"Right or wrong, we must choose. If we choose not to decide, then we still have made a choice. I say you should go for it. No matter how harsh the road we're on, we'll reach the end of we keep moving forward. However, It's not necessary for us to try and brave the conditions alone. I wish you the best.",1

I took over 20+ pills trying to OD to end up at the doctors with them believing it was a virus. I also tried cutting but I was too scared of the pain. I lived through the loneliness and pain only to be depressed again, but I came to a realization- I deserve better and I am worth it. It's definitely hard and a battle everyday, but with professional help, I am getting better day by day. You deserve better and you are worth it. Please stay strong and I do hope you talk to someone to get the help you need.",1

"Love does exist. But our modern unrealistic rendition of what it is aka the so-called Real Love unfortunately doesn't. Humans are fallible and imperfect. We can't expect them to have emotions that are perfect let alone those that remain constant forever. That said, if you go in a relationship where you both embrace each other's imperfections and be honest then I don't know if it will be perfect but at least you won't drown in regrets and disappointments if it breaks up. And maybe you'll end up being happy",0

"Bad insomnia is usually one of the first indicators of an oncoming episode. I truly wish I had hypersomnia though, the few times I got it, I wasn't rested whatsoever but I loved those little moments you have when you wake up and you can feel yourself drifting off to sleep. A feeling I've felt rarely in my 10 year struggle with insomnia alone.",1
"Yes, a know how the fuck you survived that but so fucking strong have an anxiety endured award",1

"This is how I look at it. Someone who is truly amazing in your life will change you into a new you. If that someone leaves you life somehow, you are still the new you. You still have a little bit of that someone inside of you. Once you die, that little bit of them dies inside of you as well. Do you respect those people who changed you in your life? Do you respect them enough to keep them with you? Those are the thoughts I think when I am ready to end it. Hopefully it helps you, friend.",1
Yep I do the same thing myself.,1
"Hospital stays can be helpful or horrible, depending on the staff and services provided. I hope things go OK for you while you're there. I've been where you've been. I don't know if it gets better, but you're not alone.",1
"I sincerely hope you aren't talking about suicide. If you aren't, then I think accepting depression is like accepting a loss without even trying to fight it. I've had depression for a couple of years now, and giving up seems like the only option most of the time but at some point I understood that there is at least one person that will care about you. You don't need to talk to them about it to know that they care, you just realize at one point that they enjoy being with you, and that you enjoy being with them, and if you aren't going to fight it for yourself, you should do it for them.",1
"Hm. I think they were just trying to make an off-hand joke or something. Sometimes (most of the time) co-workers berate each other. It's all banter most of the time. But if he took the time and interest to ask where you've been, I don't think he hates you. I understand why it upsets you, people like us, most people with depression, hang on to the little negative things throughout their day that most people brush off, and they eat away at us. But I want you to know, that it's okay. If it really made you uncomfortable, confront him / her about it. Or talk to HR if you want. Or your boss, or whomever. But don't hold a grudge against him / her. They most likely just didn't know how it would affect you. :c But das okay, because we're all here for you ^-^",1
I do it because it gets me tired. It also kind of makes me forget about it for a while. It wears me down.,1
"Please don't cut yourself. You can post more about your situation, I'm sure there are always people in this sub that will offer a listening ear. I would.",1
Yes it can be. I feel the exact same.,1
That makes me tired just hearing that. Feel free to message me if you want to vent. a good listener,1
"I do understand why upset. You pour your heart and soul out and do everything you can in order to make that special person happy. But keep in mind that they ask you to go above and beyond. That was a choice you made. not fair to expect them to reciprocate when the one who wanted to pamper them... I think that instead of trying to you should voice your thoughts to her. You can explain how you feel. That you hope they can try to be more ... affectionate, attentive, appreciative, etc. This is a relationship. Communication is so important but more importantly is respect for each other. If u care about her try and make her sad because hurt. And sometimes it takes time for a relationship to build trust and affection. Some people as good at dating as others. I hope doing okay whether you stay with her or not.",1

"All. The. Time. I have a job that affords me an easy lifestyle but is basically meaningless. An easy relationship for which I should have no complaints but doesn't challenge me. No real talents or super interesting hobbies. So... what am I doing? And why am I doing it? Been trying lately to shift my focus from finding my purpose to finding a purpose somewhere. It's a subtle difference but eases some of the hopeless sting of everyday life. Perhaps I missed my chance or my calling for something great, but I still have a sphere of influence in which I can affect the world and others around me.",1

I also wish to know!,1
Nope. I fell completely over the edge three times. But I'm feeling much better now.,1
"Know the feeling. My friends are married, they have kids, have homes of their own. Meanwhile, I'm still at home with my parents wondering what the fuck happened to my life at 31? But as others have said, Facebook is pretty much a crock of shit. I recently decided to out myself for being the manic depressive I am. Some people were kind about it, others pretended they gave a shit (more likely for the look how sympathetic I am play card.) Recently I've been pretty out with my highs and lows. My highs get a lot of love but as soon as I show my lows, I notice a massive difference in support. It's almost like they go out of their way to avoid the lows and reality of it. So yeah, Facebook is pretty much a crock of shit and it really does expose to you who people really are.",1
No it wouldn't. What happened?,1
"What convinced you you In my case, I had been working hard on my career but my supervisors needed to cut me off (they had a year on me but I was on their level of skill). I realized that the most important thing in the world to be taken away from me or controlled by others and that I do anything about it. Classic case of with power do what they can, those without suffer what they felt pretty pointless since.",1
That was me this morning. I felt way alone but better now,1
"I used to watch alot, but i struggle to keep my concentration now. I just end up listening to music all day. any ideas?",1
"Have you sought any professional help? I used to be depressed and lethargy and a lack of motivation were a large part of that. But to me, panic seems to be indicative of an anxiety disorder. If you can seek therapy and possibly some medication to improve your life, please do so.",1
"That's an accomplishment for most of the population to be honest. You had a productive day, be proud of yourself.",1
Can you recall times of your old self when you were happy? Was there a particular activity you did that made you happy? Identifying those activities/ hobbies while exploring new ones could help. Has there been a big life change between then and now?,0
"Kind of like you're a walking zombie? That's why I got off it, I felt that it helped with my emotions, by completely eliminating any emotions I could feel.",1
"Yes, tried to commit suicide before. I know how you feel, as if trapped in a concept, and you feel numb, or no reaction to anything. a hard time to go through and really nothing you can do, except love yourself.",1
Get some full spectrum LEDs bulbs. Works great,0
"Oh yes, I have heard this many times. The trouble is that no one has bothered to follow that statement up with *how* I push people away. You know? Like, the first time someone said it to me I had no idea it was even a thing I did, but they give me any feedback. Anyone else in the same boat? Point is, OP, I feel ya. And a sore spot.",1
This hit me. I hope that I stay with my so and be able to say this to them everyday,1
"I've felt obligated to say that to friends for so long. But a lot of them (the good, right ones) insist I don't. Because I've been there for them, they should never argue I'm too much for them if I do the same. Just know anyone who cares for you will help you.",1
"you clearly dont wanna do the math. if its for high school or some compulsory assessment, you just gotta power through it and flunk and keep moving forward away from it. if its something you chose to do, you gotta change cos theres nothing worse than being stuck doing something you hate. figure out why you are gonna flunk it, cos it makes all the difference if its something you just dont wanna do. if youre getting down about it you gotta figure out why it means so much to you. good luck i hope it goes ok anyway.",1
"It happens to me quite often. Sometimes I'm just having just another 'regular day' in which I'm busy doing work and stuff. Suddenly I realize that I'm feeling fine or even happy, and that's when all the 'bad thoughts' and 'reasons to be worried or sad' storm in. I really don't know how to deal with them. I wish I could find a way. I know I've lived through some stuff that still weighs on me and I know that time helps to ease the pain, but it's really difficult to keep it together sometimes; and being unable to enjoy the little things of each day makes it frustrating in some way. I hope that you'll find a way around it!",1
There are losses worth fighting for,1
Just do the best you can in life :)),0
"You sound like my kind of person. What are you making? Also hope you enjoy the H3H3 podcast, going to listen to it in a bit myself.",1
"hey, happy early birthday! treat yourself to something, even if it's something little.",0
"Hmm, well I've had a horrible day. But tell me what's up, and I won't stop responding , I promise. Trusting a stranger is difficult, but I'm here for you. So try to trust.",1
"I always feel awful by bothering other people with my issues, I just feel like such a burden, and sure when you say that to someone they say that it's not the case... but idk I guess people are too busy with their lives, and it's really my fault to be bothered by it so much. Like why do I have the need to want to share my problems, but hide them away at the same time? Man I'm sorry it's such a crappy feeling to have, just feeling undeserving of anything.",1
"I'm so sorry you feel that pain. I know that pain all too well. That's amazing that you went so long without it! I can hardly manage three months, and I've been doing it for years. It's hard not to do it when you have no one to talk to. You are fine. People slip up here and there.",1
How can I miss someone I never had?,0
"thats a great question, wish there was an answer",0
Well you've had a few. I doubt any of us gets a bulls eye on the first shot. Some of us never even had a chance. Give it time.,1
"everyone has problems, big or small, Whatever it is, its still a problem. Yes there is a certain degree of separation but dont think for a second because someone else is suffering more than you, That you have no right to express yourself. So what's the matter? do you want to talk about it? Were here for you :) Don't feel shy or embarrassed. Just remember one thing, If you allow this problem or problems to dwell for a long time, It will become worse.",1
"Can you reach out to any friends or loved ones? Sorry you're going through this, friend",1
"*hug* I can't remember the last time someone apart from my mom hugged me either, I need a hug or a cuddle so bad, the lack of intimacy with anyone is killing me. I feel incredibly lonely and empty all the time. I don't know how long I can go on. Best of luck!",1
"Think of it as this way, you provide a service and they compensate you for that service, its a contract. You getting fired, is just the termination of that contract, and thats it. Take your services elsewhere. Have you used indeed.com before? check it out, you might find something interesting.",0
It does feel like the human race doesn't suck as much when I'm drunk. I actually enjoy listening to what people have to say. I enjoy doing the stuff that brought me happiness when I was younger. Sucks I can't be drunk at work.,0
"Good work. Don't just hope for a good tomorrow, make it happen. Life doesn't happen to you, you happen to it. I know sometimes energy and motivation level feels out of your control, but sometimes when you're feeling low that's actually the most important time to get up and move. Today you just experienced how getting things done is what made you feel good. Too many people want to feel good first, and then act. Most times it works in the opposite way, act first and feel good after. You don't have to be at the mercy of waiting for these random days when you suddenly get something done. Make it happen. Life is like a game of momentum and inertia. Even doing something small is better than nothing. I like the mentality of trying not to have any Zero days. Don't let a day go by where you did absolutely nothing productive. It only takes something small to qualify as more than zero. And then it becomes fun trying to keep going and not letting any days slip by. Setting small goals is a good way to get moving. Large goals can seem overwhelming. Trick yourself by saying you're just going to start with 5 minutes, and often times you'll end up doing a lot more.",1
You're thinking is pretty warped. You haven't tried everything that's clealry illogical. How have those things failed? Seems isn't a definitive answer. Are there specific things you tried for a set period of time and the outcome never changed? Dealing with depression isn't what it looks like. There's no magic set of actions that make it go away. You learn to tolerate it better and manage your mood. What do you think you need the most help with?,0
Sounds like your having a tough go. So am I and misery loves company. Do you have a doctor who can look at trying something else?,0
No i dont want to read about myself id just get more bummed,0
Ugly is very subjective. There will be people who love you more than yourself somewhere in this world. You can always learn a skill. have to be complicated. Maybe learn how to cook an egg? skill. Poured cereal in milk. Skill right there:),1
"it's not my responsibility to save you but i wish i could. please reconsider, talk to people you love, do something you love, watch something you love... if you want to talk you can message me, i'm not the best helper but i'll listen. &lt;3",1
Try thinking good thought. How many women will you please with your grin if you had nice clean teeth?,0
Have you tried talking to a counselor at all?,0
"Have you seen what kind of idiots call 911? They're out of waffles! apparently is considered to be a good reason to ring them up these days! So, yeah, I'm sure the 911/112/999 operator won't be angry because you called, in fact, they'll be glad to help. You have a medical emergency - they have medical assistance available. End of story. But be honest with whoever ends up helping you. Don't bottle up your feelings, let them know why you called and what's up.",1
I relate strongly. It sucks a lot dude. I'm just numb now,1
"You writing this &amp; still being here I think that's a good sign,I think it means that deep down there's still hope that things will get better &amp; you'll start feeling happier &amp; less lonely, hold on to that feeling &amp; if you ever feel like talking feel free to message me.",1
"I'm not sure I can say I have depression but yeah, during the day I'm too busy.",0
Meds numb the sadness and make it possible to break the circle. Look at what made you cry. Work with a therapist to fill the emptiness. It's a cance not a punishment.,0
Same. And im not gonna stop failing anytime soon,1
"Same, but I have nobody I'd be comfortable with hugging so occasionally I just lie down and cry by myself.",1
Sometimes we need to start with ourselves. Do you think you provide yourself with the care you need? It is alright to lose care for things and people at times because that only tells us that we might need to look out for ourselves first.,1
"Staying at home: regret. Loneliness. Going out: pain, anxiety. Even more loneliness when being in a crowd and having nobody to talk to. I forced myself out again and again to _some_ social events that I can do and that also advance me. Where I actually can talk to people.",1
"Pretending to be happy can be extremely hard, no matter if depressed or not. Sure, depression doesn't make it any easier, thats a fact. Do you have someone you can talk to? For example have a really deep conversation, tell them about your biggest fears? Where you dont have to pretend to be happy? Wearing a mask is exhausting as hell, and the longer you try to keep it up, the more explosive will it be, when you can't hold it up any longer. In that regard, I speak from experience. And last but not least, it's completely fine to not feel happy sometimes. You just have to feel sad, out of the loop, neglected, rejected or even hated sometimes. Those are the moments where you really analyze yourself and your doings, (something you should keep under control, because too much of it is destructive), and if you embrace it, roll with it, telling yourself that this is natural and just a response of something inside you, you can't really pinpoint yet, those times could actually end up being beneficial for you. Noone feels 100% happy all the time, and if so, I'd call them liars. If you want, shoot me a pm, anytime! Keep your head up! please!",1
Yes possible.. are you having withdrawal symptoms?,1
"Hi, I just relapsed too. You're so much stronger than you think--I haven't been able to beat a month since November but maybe I will now that I'm back to seeing a therapist again. Have you considered seeing someone to talk about this?",1
"People are being exposed to the harsh reality of life earlier, thanks to the availability and ease of access of information.",0
Talking to a professional can help. It's a common question and I'm sure most would have good advice. There's a book called '10 days (maybe steps) to self esteem by a dr. Burns I believe. It's like a workbook. It helped me quite a bit.,1
"Woohoo, slaving so I can",0
"You realize what s wrong. There's many things wrong and even though you're depressed you are comfortable in some way. Because realizing you must change your ways, can put some one in a discomfort zone. Truth is, you have to leave your comfort zones behind sometime in order to work on your happiness. An example Some one who is desperately trying to lose wieght will put himself ahead with a struggle to his mind and body, but he knows that the outcome is what matters. He has to deal with discomfort to loose his wieght. There's no other way, that's just how life is. A surgery to lose wieght would be a pass. There's no free passes or shortcuts in life and many learn the hard way.",0
"Same, I just wish for an alien invasion or a cataclysm to happen soon.",1
"Life isn't about anything (or maybe it is?), but I think what makes it meaningful are the little moments, the little things. Like a cup of tea on a chilly day, petting your dog while lying in a soft bed, this sort of stuff. Unfortunately they don't make the hardships and the sadness any easier.",0
"I used to feel like that, pretty sure I have a post from a few months almost exactly the same. But it does get better friend. You can overcome those feelings, it takes effort but it is possible. Hope you get better soon",1
"Happy birthday my dude. definitely get better, I promise.",1
"Thats frustrating, Idleness makes me crazy.",1
Have you tried joining in and failed? I know how that feels man Im sorry,1
"Definitely not cured, but much better than my worst. I've found that forcing myself to do the things I used to love, even if it only holds my interest briefly, helps on bad days. I have also found music to be a great mood changer and excerise if I can force myself to do it.",1
But subs like /r/dragonsfuckingcars totally don't right?,0
"...not sure I see the problem as long as its consensual? But if it's something you want to change, sure, I can try to help. What do you feel like you get out of it? How does sexting make you feel better?",1
"That is a very true definition of sadness. Just out of curiosity, why wouldn't you want to take a risk of trying different medications that might help you? You don't know how they affect you, until you try them. You state that things are unbearable now, so it seems worthwhile to try something that might help you to be happier - even if it causes a side effect of growing a 2nd big toe on your right foot! :)  The internet is hard to scientifically research complicated subjects. Most of the better data &amp; studies are not accessible or behind paywalls.  I hope that you are feeling a little better. We get new opportunities every day, but it is hard to get over mistakes in the past sometimes. Unfortunately, we can't change the past, until I finish the time machine that I'm working on in my basement. :) Feel free to contribute to my Kickstarter fundraiser! :)",1
"It certainly doesn't hurt, given that you tell someone who is halfway decent. I find it to be a huge relief when I can talk to someone about it. It's like breathing fresh air after being in a sewer for a long time. Telling a the few close friends I have has actually strengthened our friendship as well.",1
is it gonna fuck me up and make me even sadder what kind of vid is it?,0
Beck's Sea Change. It's sad but also beautiful,0
"Just do your best man. going through dark times (probably the worst of my entire life), just keep trucking on.",1
As you get older you might be glad to find them not remembered. I think it's important to not rely on external validation (easy to say right?) but also to provide that support to others. Let's say you try to make to recognise the birthday or other significant event for at least two other people you know this year.... I don't know if that will help.,1
I know the feeling. Time heals wounds brother....,1
hey man i am in the same boat with you. Sophomore in high school and life is fucking hell. My parents have raised me to think that anything below an 85 is not reasonable so I'm terrified of going below it and I'm losing friends left and right and it sucks ass. BUT lately i have really learned i only a few friends to make me happy. Things do get better man i promise.,1
I would consult the doctor before doing anything because a certain amount of one medication can affect others.,0
"I feel like a pro would be validation. When a psychiatrist told me that yes, I do have anxiety, it really helped me to feel like I wasn't just over reacting you know? Another pro would be future doctors that you see understanding your diagnoses. I can't really think of an con to be honest. It's also possible that whoever is prescribing your medication has diagnosed you already. I would ask!",1
"Sometimes the reasons for having depression are irrelevant. If your gut instincts are telling you you may be depressed, then there could be some truth to it. At this stage you should be seeking treatments and seeing if you notice any differences in how you feel. I'd recommend running outdoors for 45 minutes at least 5 times a week. This is actually more powerful than antidepressant medication and without unhealthy side effects - on the contrary - it strengthens connections in the brain which are responsible for feeling good. Give this a try and see how you feel.",1
"I get it. I got out of my bed, picked up my books (to study), my pc, but then just went to another bed I have at home. :/",1
Why would anyone in their right mind be on this sub if they beat it? They'd be outside doing things.,0
"Sending some good vibes and prayers your way! I hope you find the help you seek with your treatments and if this isn't what helps please don't ever stop looking. Exercise became my escape but it wasn't through cardio or weight training like I had done for years with zero progress towards self improvement, it came in the form of dancing. Best of luck and please feel free to DM me when you need to vent about anything!",1
"People are invisible to me in the streets. They don't exist. I always walk like if there was nobody walking because I don't have so much attention to waste. I can make everyone vanish in my brain even if I'm walking inside a crowd. I tend to pretend I am walking inside a crowd of dolls or machines with sleepy consciousness/energy. I do it all the time because I need to think clearly and **focus**. Staring at moving people with different shapes, clothes and colors distract my focus and disrupt my peace of mind and suck my **energy**. But I like it when people direct their attention to me and stare at me because they subconsciously feed me with their energy and make me feel alive and they loose their vital energy in return which is **s**o sad. I need to stare at the horizon or the sky to focus and to give for the moment a **meaning** that the majority can not see because they are busy talking to others, staring at others, using their phones and giving their consent and **paying attention** and their **time** to others for nothing in return. They have no idea about the importance of these **moving** people and that they are in fact moving vital energies and one must focus to absorb those free energies of life. Movement in space creates time.",1
"Hey man, go outside. Take a walk to somewhere neat around where you live. Get some fresh air and take some deep breaths. Embrace the beauty of nature for a few minutes and get that sense of peace. For those moments don't think of anything, just exist. It's surprisingly relieving.",0
"What happened? &gt; I wasn't scared. I wasn't anything. Just pissed off at the guy for blaming me. Lol. i've had the same thing happen a few days ago at a crossover and i remember just thinking *Either kill me or don't, don't give me hope.*",1
"You know that feeling when you wake up in the morning and realise that you don't have to get up for another hour, so you go back to sleep? That's how I imagine death to feel. Just a peaceful slipping away. No pain, no fear. Just peace and rest. I'm almost ready for it to be honest.",0
Is your family having money trouble?,0
"the first person i opened up to was a girl i thought i was close friends with, but i was also a little bit in love with. what a mistake i know this sounds dumb, but like, i feel like your problems, you just have to get over them, i feel like it's all in your head fuck my ass man. people who haven't felt this, or just don't have the self awareness to recognize it (cause god damn this girl had her low moments too but she clung so hard onto the idea that she was fine. she's not) can really say some hurtful things.",1
Happy birthday. And crying is always okay. :),1
tbh i did not remember it was the 31st today till i was sending a meme about getting drunk and fighting a raccoon for nye . i checked my phone to see when nye would be and i was like oh darn too soon. but im home alone with my cats and theres shitty loud awful music playing in my neighborhood. and it is going to go on all night.:c,0
"Ugh, you are absolutely right; the world and humans are a mess. This might not make you feel better but it has always been a mess. It actually isn't really much worse than it has always been. I read a certain amount of history and have come to realize this. Even if you just read the Old Testament you can see how crappy people were. One thing that helps me is to stay away from news. I don't think it makes us informed if all we know is the bad stuff. Also try subscribing and reading Uplifting News on a regular basis. Made Me Smile is also a good. Finally to really get informed about the good stuff going on in the world, volunteer. I prefer Habitate for Humanity; you meet people from all walks of life doing what little they can to help others. This doesn't make the news very often but is happening everyday.",1
"I feel pretty anxious myself. But when i have no choice I just come to the point where i think what's the worse that could happen? maybe I faint. But then there are people to help me. If I panic I can just excuse myself and leave. If the situation gets to much, I can leave anytime. And just knowing that I am always in controll of what I am doing helps me a lot. Having trouble in the subway? Well, you can pull the breaks anytime. That's pretty expensive and affects a lot of people but just knowing that I could is a big plus. I am not a prisoner in these situations. I am free. I can leave whenever I want. But sometimes I realize I panic because of no logical reason. I tell that myself. Than I make a breathing exercise and it calms down. My therapist told me, when you have the feeling of not getting enough air breath through a straw. It calms you down, makes you hear your breath and you start focussing on it. &amp;#x200B; I hope that helped &amp;#x200B;",1
"I wanna be lonely with you guys to. Here's one big lonely hug , squeeze hard might be the only one you get. I'm alone by myself oh so lonely, just want to feel close to another like myself, I'm blown away by the shear lone that has overcome me, will I ever break the chains that imprisoned me to lonliness. Am I to endure this for the rest of my life?",1
"roll with the bald look i say! i dont really think twice when i see a bald person, regardless of age :)",1
"Dont do it man. I consider it every day, but you need to keep pulling forward. even if the world throws everything at you, you need to keep pulling strong. Even of you dont believe it, things will get better.",1
What is it that you're overthinking?,0
"It helped at the beginning of my marijuana usage when I was smoking maybe 2-3 times a week but if it can spiral out of control pretty quickly to where it creates a vicious cycle of abuse. The marijuana also blew my anxiety through the roof. In my experience, the depression will come back once not high (and sometimes even worse than it was before getting high) which has the potential for psychological dependence. Within 9 months of beginning self medication I went from smoking like $10 worth 2-3 times a week to 2-3 times a day so beware. By the end of the 9 month period I was spending about $200 a week on weed. Would possibly recommend but i think the best idea for those with addictive/binging personalities because you could end up seriously abusing it during massive depressive episodes.",1
The mind replays what the heart can't delete.,0
"I have that problem too. Some things my CBT therapist suggested were: cold cloth on face, smelling lavender, taking a brisk walk, breathing exercises, and watching something funny. I truly hope you escape that dark cloud. I can confirm that I'm glad I lived to do and have the things I've done, despite pits of gravityless depression, despair and cutting. I believe you will find your way to good things as well.",1
"it's so taxing after awhile. i think sometimes it's fine, the pretending, and maybe will even trick me for a brief moment. but over time it's just so exhausting to keep up.",1
Do you mind if I ask why?,0
"All the time, I wouldn't want to kill myself. But it wouldn't bother me if I didn't wake up tomorrow.",1
Did you kill someone? Did you horribly abuse someone? Or is there a voice in your head just telling you that you don't deserve help?,0
What is something you can do that would feel healthy and bring you a sense of hope. Do you have a loving friend to reach out to? Do you have a pet you may be able to hang out with? A faith group that brings you peace? What's one thing you could do right now that would feel like a healthy step and would bring you some positive vibes.,0
"Don't do it. If I believe in most things science taught me is that dying would be the ending not only for you now, but for the future you that could have done something good and right. Don't miss the chance of doing something great in the future.",1
"For most people, some combination of lifestyle (food, sleep, exercise), medication, and talk therapy. But obviously it depends on the person.",0
"ask him what about you does he think has changed, and try working from there. Maybe he's just trying to understand you better but didn't really know how to approach the situation",0
I hope you're okay. There's always reason to fight even when it feels like there's nothing.,1
"I heard GoT is going to have an epic season this year... look you have to find your own reasons for living and it's harder when you're depressed, don't make permanent decisions on temporary feelings ans situations. Everything changes with or without you, be open to new experiences, there's more out there than what you want, you might not get what you want but if you try sometimes you get what you need",1
"fuck society, listen to your feelings.",0
"I do landscaping during spring through fall. It's just me, not for a company. Through word of mouth, I started working for this nice couple. They new nothing about my mental illness and made me feel so comfortable, I told them. They have been unbelievably supportive. They've adopted me as their grandson and continuously check to see how I'm doing and to take me to breakfast or lunch. I'll even be going to Canada with them in a few months. It was a wonderful reminder that there are really good people in this world once you get to know them.",1
I would hold the shit out of you,1
Because you'll miss the beautiful moments ahead of you that are just waiting for you to witness them,0

Lol story of my life too but sometimes you can use the tragic events in your life as understanding and a way to help others,0
"Not me, but search through older posts--a lot of people have written about it. Good luck ... please update when you can. I hope it helps you.",1
Sorry you are feeling that way but How do you know it was a lie? In My experience most people don't compliment unless they meant it. Excluding family or friends who may just be telling u what they think u wanna hear of course. Who complimented you and in what context?,1
"hey guys, another one of you guys here. lets all vent to each other? lets spit some emotions out. i feel hopeless. helpless. alone. empty.",0

"Sometimes the people who care are the ones you least expect, talk to someone who you trust alot and tell them everything... sometimes advice from someone you know personally, has more impact then someone from the internet.... all you can really do is talk it it and, if it gets worse, GO TO A DOCTOR, hope i helped a bit -Kyle",1
"I know how you feel, especially now that almost every day I get more and more bad news and more crap is piling on top of the old ones. It gets harder seeing other people having fun together when I am alone. It gets harder seeing my friend online, but doesn't want to talk to me.",1
I wish I even had the will to play games. For me it's excessive daydreaming.,0
I think it's just how you end your dreams. Sometimes if I get too carried away I feel sad after but usually I like to just finish with well that was nice and try not to get too hurt,1
Maybe not melt but i often feel so absent from it. My head feels so slow and i feel like not even part of the chaos that is going on in it. Maybe similar to what experiencing.,1
"I will. I'm a heroin addict and sick as hell. I'd like someone to talk to, too. PM me.",1
Go to a better therapist.,0
Your mom sounds verbally abusive. I'm sorry you feel like this. I hope things get better for you soon.,1

"My dad was depressed. He had a lot of mood swings, which were difficult to deal with as a kid. And made me feel very worthless",1
I don't want to keep waking up at 1 am it's hard,1
I'm sorry to hear that. If you are able to you could channel that sadness into a drawing or poem or something like that. It might help a little.,1
"Talk to him about it, maybe he forgot it was your b-day or he had an emergency? For better or for worse, talk to him about it and clear it up or else that terrible feeling you currently have is going to stick around for a sometime.",0
me too almost 0400 rn. i really want to sleep all the time so i can get away from the pain but i always have scary dreams about causing it,1
"Maybe you could break the routine somehow, like change your study space? Go to a cafe or the library or stay in your dorm (if you're in college)? That's what I tried to do when I was in a studying slump. I went to a cafe instead and it helped a little bit. You could even treat yourself to something there. That definitely relaxed me. As for a means for motivation, if my depressive symptoms didn't completely take over, what used to drive me during hard times was my end goal, the career I was aiming for. Hope this helps!!",1
"Maybe it would exhaust them more over time. But the thing is that if you were to kill your self they would feel unimaginable pain and guilt. They may learn to cope with the pain but they will find ways to blame it on themselves. They will think it because they did or do something and it will haunt them for life. Talk with your family, work through it together, accept their love and try to understand why they say and do certain things from their point of view so you can understand their love for you. It will most likely be tough at first but it will make things easier.",1
What have you tried in order to combat depression?,0
How did the run go?,0
temporarily but it never seems to last,0

"Because of your depression or your partners?  My ex broke up with me because of hers. At the time she said she still loved me but needed to get better (really true, she was a nutcase). We recently talked after a few months of NC and her getting leveled out on anti-depressants. Her hurt was not the same as mine. Her emotions were flat-lined. Anhedonia. The sadness, anger, frustration, confusion, despair that I felt are emotions she was incapable of feeling. I know this because I was severely depressed myself years ago. Even now since she is on SSRI's, and with it being months later, I don't think her hurt is even close to what mine was. I think her hurt is more in regret. I honestly doubt she will ever truly hurt over this breakup - by the time she's off the meds and capable of feeling those raw emotions again, it will probably be a total of 1-2 years since the breakup. She'll only have to deal with regret - if even that.  Of course some cynical side of me wants her to feel what I did. I want her to grieve the loss of our relationship like I did. I want her to think about what we had, let those good memories fill her with the positive emotions we had together, and have them followed up by sadness over the realization she lost it. But when I really think about it, I know I don't want that to happen. She cried enough when she started sinking lower into depression. The outbursts, the frustration, the fear of losing me. I remember how much that happened. She hurt too, it just happened for months before the breakup, where mine was after.",1

I'm sorry to hear that. How long have you been dealing with depression? Life is indeed very messy and hard. I'd hang out with you and buy you a drink and listen to your story if I could.,1
"Yes. I find maintaining friendships is so exhausting, and I can barely manage the other stuff in my life as is. I know that when I disappear for a bit because it's all too much, no one will be there when I come back. I also feel like I don't really have much in common with the people I talk to. They're all so motivated and seem to maintain social lives so effortlessly. They talk about their weekends at clubs and hanging out and I think of how I spent my weekend playing video games for 10 hours instead of doing papers and it makes me feel completely isolated.",1
"your illness does not make you any less deserving of love, nor any harder to love. can it make you harder to deal with? yes. and not everyone will be able to deal with it, and you can never ask anyone to. but someone who cannot deal with it is not right for you. i am one of the people who choose to deal with it, my bf is severely depressed and has anxiety. i don't love him any less for it, he was already suffering from it when i met him and i still saw right through it, saw who he was. (kind and excitable and loving) when you're suffering, first and foremost what you need is to get better. being loved, by family or friends or a partner, is part of that. having a partner is not essential, though. i can talk about this for hours if you want me to, but it's important for any relationship you have to be healthy and not turn toxic. you are not a burden, you are not unlovable. at this point in your life people who you have close relations with have to be able to understand and support you. and you deserve that, and those people exist. it can be hard to imagine, when people are depressed their life is usually not in a state where they're very connected to like-minded people. but anything can happen, and things can change. and even without change, you can encounter great things. i can tell you about my experience if you ever want.",1
"Just because you feel like you're headed in that direction, doesn't mean you actually are...and if you are, you can always turn the car around. You're the only one who controls the ride and where it goes. I've had many days (and I still have those days) where I've lost hope in life. Feel like there is no point to go on because no matter how much I try to get things on track, I fail. That no one cares about me, and if I were gone the whole world would have one less body to deal with. But, then I realize that these things are not permanent or untrue, and If i am not happy, I can change it...but, you can not change suicide. Try to take a step back and think about what brings you joy in your life currently, and think of the things you've enjoyed while growing up, and surround yourself with them. Try something new that you've always wished you'd try. These are all steps to a better life, one that's happier...and is definitely possible to achieve. It takes some time and work, but in the end it is worth it. Don't give up, the best things in life are always the ones that make you work the hardest for. Feeling like this, is not permanent, it's only temporary. You have many people who care for you, who I am quite certain will notice if you're gone, and would be devastated... not to mention the hundreds of other people you're robbing from the chance of getting to meet someone as amazing as you, too! Stay strong, and remember that it will always be okay. Life is what you make it.",1
"The only thing making me hesitant is my family. Seven siblings, four of them younger than me, and nothing scares me more than one of the little kids having to go through something that can leave them traumatized. On top of that, money is a big problem right now and I don't want my parents to have to deal with the costs. I feel so freaking stuck.",0
"There's no better person to tell someone something than a nurturing mother. They typically love you unconditionally. Friends and significant others get a scent of the depression on you and they distance themselves as it becomes a deeper problem as opposed to helping. If your mother loves you, she will understand.. And it's not like you are admitting you have gay sex or addictions to banging drugs up your arm or killed someone... This is (not to be insensitive) remotely benign to say to your family.. They might be able to recommend something that helps..",1

"I hope it gets better for you. Just remember to take care of yourself while you are depressed. What do you tell people to do when they are sick with the flu? You tell them to drink water, get plenty of rest, don't overexert, and eat bland foods. Drink tea, medicine, whatever. This is recommended for the most rapid recovery. If they neglect this advice, they run the risk of getting sicker. What do you tell someone who is sick with depression? Just do your best to keep up with life. Make sure you eat, make sure you sleep, brush your teeth, do whatever chores you would normally do, try not to turn to any vice or addiction, and avoid isolating yourself. If you upkeep with life, you are more likely to see a faster recovery. If you fail to upkeep, you run the risk of digging a hole and becoming more depressed. You are strong, and you got this. Best of luck to you.",1

its so weird being depressed and feeling like i cant help other depressed people. so when i think of what to say my first thought is WEL1 W4T I5 MAKING U DEPRESSED? Is there something going on in your life bud?,0
"Similar for me. I fell like depression makes you care less about yourself. I remember once walking the streets and jaywalking at every corner. I was like, so what if I get hit by a car, worst case scenario I die, it's not as if that matters. I wasn't actively trying to get myself killed, just ignored my surroundings and my own safety. Fortunately I snapped out of it at some point, or I might not be here anymore.",1
"I have to kickstart my ass into getting out of the house. Go to a museum, arboretum, take a walk somewhere. Once I get going, it's okay for a few hours. But that only works when I don't wake up and start drinking. Sometimes when I come back home it's the same old despair all over again.",1

Read self improvement articles,watch porn and masturbate,and clean my house. My advice for you you find yourself jobless is: # Do not waste your time. Do not lock yourself in your room and watch porn&amp;masturbate all long.Find something useful to do with your free time.Recharge your batteries.Start working out,you don't need to go to gym,just take a run in the morning and one in the evening.Build your emotional resilience.I do this by reading about it first (I am in the process of finding out what it means and then I have to apply it).A good start is r/Stoicism.Make yourself useful - clean your house and take care of your pets.

"Yes, I have. Currently I am a mess. Nevertheless there used to be a time when I was a mess, but still had a reason to pick myself up and get my shit done. If you want to study and pass your exams, this is what I did: - Get busy studying now (within 15 minutes). No excuses to eat/drink a bit. Not going to the bathroom. Just study. Phone away. If possible laptop/computer away. Do this for at least one hour and take a small break to get fresh air if you want and drink some water. NO PHONE. Then back to studying. Again one hour or more. - After studying go for a run (I don't care if it is 11 pm) or exercise in some other way. - Eat healthy. You crave good tasting food? chocolate? chips? No go. When you go to the supermarket, fast food is not an option. You will not spend your money on that shit. No chips, no sweet stuff, no special drinks. Fruit/vegetables/carbs/meat/fish/bread/milk/yoghurt. Healthy stuff. Lots of water. - Go to bed on time. Get out of bed on time. - No thinking! Only actions. - Do one thing at a time. No thinking about tomorrow or the next hours. Just about the next minute. What are you going to do now? Shower? check. Dress? check. Breakfast? check. Go to library? check. Study one hour? check. Have a small break and drink water? check. continue. - If possible, study with other people - (added) When I get stuck, it has been VERY helpful for me to discuss this with other students. This has been very difficult for me, because I have a crazy amount of pride and am very ashamed of showing I do not understand something. Nonetheless, it has helped me so much to just discuss a problem where i got stuck with someone and then see the light which enables me to continue studying (instead of procrastinating till everything went to shit). This doesn't solve the deeper problems, but it probably will get you through your exams as good as possible. At least, this is how I managed to finish my undergraduate years. Not healthy, but it worked. Also you will probably find that by being so hard for yourself, setting boundaries and actually following them, you will start to feel a lot better about yourself and gain confidence. This is a trap, do not get satisfied with yourself. Being satisfied and giving yourself more space to slightly cross your boundaries again is equal to getting on the slide that will get you right back into the pit. This became a rant, hope it helps you in some way.",1

Some people like this guy, because he provides a brief moment of contentment in a horrible clashing world.

this year after a year no incident. it felt so familiar and delicious in a way only those had the habit will know. but its not a good habit. its just not healthy to have open wounds constantly and cutting yourself to handle problems wont help you deal with whats upsetting you. it instead will be a permanent reminder of the pain you feel now. what if instead you used the energy to do something constructive. express yourself. do whatever you Need to do. you Want to cut. you dont need to. you never have. it was just a coping mechanism. you lived without it before and theres no good reason to do it. you dont need to do this. youre not weak or damaged for losing to your emotions and giving into yourself now. but dont lose yourself in the idea that you have to throw all the progress you made away. its been three years and cut yourself once in all those three. thats something to be proud of. sorry this is kinda long but i personally cut for the first time at 11 and it become a habit til 13. i had a relapse myself earlier this year and i know the urge may never go away completely but its something you can control. you can gain greater satisfaction doing something that fulfills you rather than damages you. its just a fact.,1
Yea I self harmed once because I kept not lining up the edges of a paper thing perfectly,1
I just get nauseous and anxious,1
Me too. I think about this constantly and it gives me a lot of anxiety as well. I would have studied something different in school and actually have fun at my job. Sometimes I cry about it but what can you do...,1
My meds (been on at least 12 different ones over the years) never changed my emotions but usually made me feel that I had the right to feel them and that I could manage them. Like I would feel anxious and sad but my brain had the capability to say yes this sucks but we are moving past it and can fix it or forget it. With depression I can't do that..it just consumes me,1

Sounds very similar to myself. Depression is a common part of my life but even when I'm not going through a cycle I still suffer from this blank mind where I simply can't organize a thought or put anything into words. I've come to a realization that it may be a form of anxiety. For me it can feel like an internal panic attack.

The only reason we spoke that day is because I said to him ,,That's a cool watch ,what brand is that ?,,.

They will be there at all times for you, and you for them. Who knows, they even migth help you find a partner! 2- Go and meet new people. I know its hard, but if you want to find love, do it. Get to know people. Talk to them, be their friends. If you have any party or any event, go. You will eventually find someone that likes you, and you like her. Also, don't look for sex. You will never fuck on the first date, and sex is not the only thing that matters in life. Would you fuck a doll with no feelings? Always talk with girls with the mentality that you won't have sex with them. Gurls also feel love. 3- Keep living with your pillow. If you don't have the motivation or will to do the 2 things i mentioned earlier, remember that atleast you will have a pillow that loves you, and a anonymousor that cares about you.",0

"Yes right. So my rational mind would tell me right now dealing with something but as experience has showed me I will be better once through it. So the practical thing for me to do would be to relax and be aware of my tendencies to fall victim to my emotions which in turn produce thoughts that are self destructive and wasting my time. See to be emotional is irrationality and far from practical. Take some time out and just breathe and let the shit go...you got this. you are right now...literally and I want to fall into those emotions and spread the way I feel everywhere. I want those who love me to know and those who hate me to know more but in the f u kinda way. But we because we have been here before and got through it-and we were happy again-and bam we are here now. But we will be happy again.

"Sometimes, when something happens in the moment, we see it as this huge thing because it is the center of our focus. It is only once those moments pass that we can look back and connect the dots to see that it really wasn't such a big deal. So my advice is this: As you look forward, remember that in the past the dots have always connected correctly, and have faith that those dots will connect the way they need to again. People often ask me why I don't worry about these seemingly huge problems in my life. Well, it's not that I don't worry, because I do. That's just being human, but I constantly remind myself that things usually just work out, and I just need to run the course that I see in front of me. So follow the course, stay on track, and when little problems feel like mountains in front of you, have faith that the dots will connect, and you will come out the other side as a stronger person. Good luck, my friend.",1

"Well, is moved into a new home a few months ago, befor that i always had to walk 30 - 60 minutes to get where ever i had to go (sschool, work, train station and so on). Everyone was always so confused why i liked to walk the whole way, even if someone would offer me to drive to work,s chool, or back home again. I just liked to put my headphones on, listen to music, and let my thoughts just flow. I HAD to go from A to B, so i wouldn't worry about something i still have to do, because i could do nothing while i had to walk from A to B. I could just disconnect from my life for a while. And it always felt great. Dont get me wrong, all the bad thoughts, the bad emotions and feelings weren't gone, but it was just different, in a beautiful way.

"what are you needing help with? part of the problem with anti depressents is how easily and flippantly they are prescribed. There is use for these medications but should be far more proper professional analysis before determining the correct meds, and monitoring. Lack of health care support means throwing the most widely used ones at a patient, refer a psych and hope for the best. They are not terrible, can help in many people but take so long to be effective and are hit and miss so its a tough solution when in a present difficult crisis. Sometimes doctors will prescribe short term assistance like Benzos and tranquilizers to keep stable in the short term, I found this works better for me than long term anti-depressents.",1

He tells a woman that he loves her but she rejects him, saying that he doesn't know what love is and that he doesn't even love himself.

Call your own therapist if you have one, let their answering service know you are in severe crisis, or head to the nearest ER and tell them you are having a mental health crisis. There are other ways to deal with this besides suicide. I have been there. Things have gotten better. I do struggle with at least a few things every day but not the way I do during what I call a crisis. I'm actually in a small crisis state right now, which led me to this board and trying to do the things my therapist has given me to do in the past like up my seroquel and ativan and rest as much as possble for a few days.",1
so sorry hurting so much. here.,1

I'm locked in a viscous cycle between my physical and mental illnesses. Been diagnosed with major depressive disorder for close to 5 years now. About 2 years ago I developed a movement disorder. It has been documented but not yet diagnosed as doctors haven't figured out anything about it. The depression triggers the non epileptic seizures which cause major disturbances in my life. Crippling my quality of life and reducing what I can do. This feeds into my depression. More negative mental health the worse and more frequent the seizure like symptoms happen. Also have bad tremors and ticks in relation to the non epileptic seizures. I often fall down and have issues walking and standing. Can barely leave my home. Am reduces to limit movement inside my home which has caused weight gain from decrease movements which also stregnthens my depression which in return causes more seizure like episodes. No medication helps my mental or physical health. It actually worsens both. I am going without treatment because doctors refuse to take it seriously or are completely dumbfounded. It has been over a year since anything was prescribed to attempt to help me. Seen several specialist. This terrible cycle has lead me to multiple suicide attempts in the last few months.,1
"There are people, who want to know more if you don't fake it.. but some people are not worth knowing your secrets.. so just don't mind them, smile and move on. However, it can become stressful if you have nobody to talk to in a realistic way as possible without anything fake at all on you. With people, where you can toss that mask away for a moment and just be that negative little cunt for a moment lol.. we all need it sometimes.",1
"you are not alone, no live no friends no job. I graduated with 3.8 out of 4.0 from engineering college, I worked very hard after that nobody want to hire me.College is shit. now I stay home 24/7 literally nothing to do. I live with my parents, 23 years old. I want to die now. I am crying all the time, I don't know why I am here.Live is suck",1
I use to be miserable. I hated my wife. My life. Lots of stuff. But one day I just Decided to be happy. I got up. Told by bitch wife I loved her. Kissed her. Got up and sang in the shower. But i was miserable again in an hour. But then the next day i tried again. And the next afternoon. Again and again. Finally my wife wasnt a bitch anymore. My life wasnt so bad. I realized being miserable can be a choice. Our emotions can be changed by our actions. Wake up and just pretend to be happy. Pretend you like your job. Fail and do it again.,0
"Sometimes, I feel like this is okay though. The not being okay. I think there's this expectation we all have just because everyone else and everything around us shows this picture perfect life that is normal. Also, I get to the opinion sometimes that when none of it matters, it's actually the most liberating, because then I am truly free of my worldly concerns. I don't know. Silver lining and framing and all that jazz. Best of luck, friend.",1
"For me, it's the number of times I say, I hate my life and I hate people.",0
Yes! Dating can get you out of depression. Not without medical attention though. I'd tell from the get go,1
I went to counseling yesterday and the counselor confirmed it. All I could think when I walked out of her office was ...fuck. I'm mentally ill?. I thought I was just being me my whole life and I'm still in extreme disbelief.,1
"I know it's obvious but don't ween too quickly. I don't know your drug but from my experience, I was fine until I got too cocky and lowered my dose way too quickly. I got sick, anxious, depressed, I threw up a few times. It sucked so just stay safe.",1
Same. And somehow I always trick myself into believing I'll find it some day. How fucking naive am i.,1
Why do you crave this attention?,0
I'm sorry you feel this way. Is there anything in particular that's bothering you?,1
Some days I go the whole day without even knowing what day it is. And fuck I hate weekends.,1

"The only part of your life you get to experience is the present, and you gotta set aside some of that experience for the future. The past will always be happier or sadder because you have to recreate it every time and it gets a bit more distorted every time.",0
"just a stranger on the internet, but not alone. here to listen.",1
"I'd say that they choose to endure it... It's just that they have a more hopeful insight, they can fully understand something good will happen from their work, and they can grasp that it's real. That's why I sometimes wonder if Depression is stunted cognition (maybe imagination), because if I could imagine the beauty that life has to offer I'm sure that no matter what got in my way I'd plow through. Why would neurotypicals work so hard if they couldn't in some way see the other side, feel it, almost experiencing it? I just think we're unable to do that.",0
It really does suck... Just waiting for an accident to happen or to finally snap and actually do something.,1
If you're ever feeling really down and feel you have nobody to talk to always call a help line. Plus what even if calling does nothing it's first occupied you for some time so that you don't do anything else and secondly it's better then not even bothering to call at all. Please call a help line and trust me it's what you need to do right now.,1
"Yeah, I just feel like, I don't care at all. But I know people are missing me at home when I'm stuck here studying for my finals but honestly I like it here, alone. In fact, I've decided not to answer any phone calls from my family because I just want to vanish from their attention.",1
That's not the real you. It just feels more comfortable but it's not. I hope you can see that. Stay strong friend.,1
"Yeah man I can relate. Especially with the crying and screaming thing. I wonder what's stopping us from crying? And what's worse is I've even had friends comment on how I don't get upset easily or mad about certain things that are usually normal to be mad about. But how can I if I don't even feel like I'm a real human being, yah know? I wish we could escape the void inside ourselves.",1
"I'm so glad you're happy! It's nice to see happy people :) Also, happy birthday! Hopefully your day turns/turned out well!",1
I like poems (but the ones I write are bad). Do you have any more you want to share with the world?,0
Good question I would like to know to,0
"Trust me, don't do it. I have a scar on my left arm where I cut really deep and it gives me anxiety from people seeing it and depresses my mood looking at it. Doesn't help that I'm in fucking GCSEs either, but anyway I'm rambling. I know you wanna see blood; that's how I was too. But just don't, for me.",1
"I was thinking the same thing like a minute ago. It's kinda reassuring to know I won't have the courage to take my own life, but I'm scared at the thought of what if I'll find the courage? honestly.",1
"My ex used to feel like this, as did I (we both had problems) and the best we could do was talk and be completely honest on where we stood with things like this. I hope he doesn't leave just because he maybe feels overwhelmed. But I've been on both ends, and felt a burden as well, so you aren't alone on that. I really do hope things work out. If you ever need a PM buddy, I have a pretty free schedule and am always looking for more pen pals, and possibly more friends.",1
Test mean literllery nothing. in like 3 years you proballey wont even remember that test,1
Could you tell us more? visiting my hometown too and I kind of have an... uneasy feeling with it too. Feels like I achieved anything since I left home and is still the same weak and shy little guy. But at the same time I also grew estranged with my hometown and my friends and family over here. Idk if that even made any sense but hey have an internet hug buddy the least I could do,1
"All meaning is made up. Maybe find solace in the fact you are just valuable/invaluable as anything else: Doves, cows, trees, minerals, other humans, stars. Try to see what about your life you hate so much, specifics, and try to change those things. PLay with things you are scared to do, do things that will make you feel better about yourself and your life, read positive mantras, read books that make your mental concept of the world expand. Force yourself onto new experiences. I think with time one's self loathing can be softened. After all the self loathing didnt come from you but from other's, from the environment. Babies dont hate themselves.",0
"Hey, what grade are you in? 29 and I have felt that way many many times especially when I was going through school. Negativity is temporary I promise you. Honestly high school is just a blip on the radar for you I swear. It feel like it now but damn are you going to feel good when you persevere. And you will persevere I promise you, I promise you that you can do it. If you need someone to talk to feel free to message me if you are comfortable. I grew up in a dirty and chaotic home with cat shit behind the couches and the TV and everything smelled bad,all the clothes smelled like mildew and my parents were upset and angry all the time and there were drugs involved and I was overweight and nobody was helping and yada yada yada and I just want you to know that no matter how bad it gets, you build a unique strength that no one else can even touch upon just by making it day by day. Your experience, is one that I understand I promise you and you are going to come out of this a bad ass. I promise you can do it",1
"I feel that way, but somehow I always manage to lose even more if someone insults me, so clearly I've got some buried somewhere. I wish I could just have no self-esteem, so that I could get that insult immunity, but nope, whenever I think I'm out I find more to lose.",1
It's the last thing I'll do. But I have too much to do first.,0
"I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. A person can be cared for by dozens and still feel alone, depression is a monster. I hope you're able to make progress against it in your own way, or by talking to people you trust, living the life you want to live, or by obtaining professional help. Please send me a message if you would like to talk to someone privately.",1
"I'm in the same boat, if I do get drunk it's not the fun kind it's more like all those depressing thoughts start boiling over. I don't drink liquor anymore for that reason, now I stick to a few beers every night and that's usually enough to help me relax.",1
"Everybody has a thing for 10s tho, numeral ratings for people are dumb anyways. If you get to know people you can develop feelings for them not only based on physical appearance or even find out after all they're not that attractive in the end. Granted it plays a huge part initially and people who say otherwise are hypocrits but yeah it doesn't just stop there. But still, I am ugly and I hate myself haha",0
"Only you can answer the question. I personally find video game is a good way to enjoy my life. Though I agree that the hamster wheel and rat-race pretty sucks, but I just don't see much alternative at this point if I want to keep doing what I do now...",1
You asking for reasons is the biggest reason of all.,0
"I started this a little while ago too. Don't do it often, once every few months or so when I get really worked up and I start losing myself. Thing is, I like it. Not in a weird kinky way lmao but like, man it just gets me so revved up ya know? Like after I feed myself a few shots with each hand and I can feel the side of my face starting to swell up I feel like I can take on the fucking world head on. It's something that has actually made me heavily consider taking up boxing because it's win win. I get to punch something AND I get to get punched in the face back.",1
"I feel this way too. For me, it's a strange feeling because I'm constantly on the verge of the tears but if I try and let myself cry, I can't.",1
"You have done your best, and therefore this cannot be called failing! No matter how long you have managed to abstain from self-harm, this is an achievement that no one can take away from you. You have learnt ways to cope and live life without self-harming because you did it for four Therefore, you are starting with more knowledge than you had when you stopped self-harming for the first time.",1
"Yeah I'm working a PSW job and it pains me to see these people who are forced to or even worse don't have anything to do but lay in bed. You see the effects of social isolation and the lack of control. I work with a person with ABI and as much he tries to stay positive, the frustration seeps out of him all the time. The little things we take for granted like going to the bank, buying groceries, picking up prescriptions become so regulated and standardized in their lives, that you can't expect any other reaction but frustration. It's affected my personal life with my relatives because I get so angry thinking about how there is no way to make them better and I lash out for the littlest reasons on them. I understand it's all about perspective but in the already depressed state I'm in, I know I'm not cut out to help other people feel better. Putting in my 2 weeks on April 16th, and heading back to school in May. I can't keep working there, it's making me much more emotional than when I started.",1
"Hard to end the spiral. Like the post above says, find out where you can break the feedback loops and go little by little.",0
"No one deserves to be alone. You sound like you're going through a hard time. I am, too, but lately I've been feeling more confident and hopeful. What's bothering you? You seen like you might think you'll be alone forever.",1
"I have major issues with sleeping too much. I can't sleep when I want to at night and then I sleep all day. I set an alarm to wake me up at 12 and usually snooze it for an hour. If I turn it off then I don't get up until 4PM. I can't say I get any sort of fog feeling though, just incredibly tired.",1
Me too..depression clouds our judgment. It gets really hard to think about things clearly. Hate this feeling but it won't go away yet.,1
its not about her as such its more so like the fact i tried again and failed. but you know i hate swallowing pills so i doubt ill be able to swallow enough to kill me. I am up to about 11 so far,0
"a cool way of looking at it, I have never felt that way but I hope I can one day. Cheers!",0

"Same. Was feeling good a few weeks ago after dealing through a rough break up but then life hits you sometimes and it fucking sucks. I hope you're doing well, OP. If you'll ever need somebody I'm just a chat away",1
Hopefully he's a nice guy and doesn't punch you,1
"Hi there, you know that is a very good question and I used to have similar thoughts as you. I now have a question to ask you, why would other be happy with you when you are not happy with yourself? The thing is, we need to develop self love and self care first. Because without it, we will be too dependent on others and that becomes burdensome because no one's life is perfect and they all have their own issues to deal with. Even though other people wants to love you and support you, they can only do it to a certain extent. The rest of the void that you have inside of you can only be filled by yourself. I know you don't feel it but being able to learn to self love is the key to happiness because that is when you feel like your life is in your control again, not on others. I would recommend you to google how to self love or seek therapy to talk this over and find out what your root cause is. There is always help and a better life when you decide to become better and healthier. I speak from experience. You will get better, believe in yourself.",1
"Atleast I'm not alone in this situation, also that really sucks",0

hell yes thats a win! Keep fighting and try running some laps. It'll make you feel great!,1
i feel like its mostly fake which sucks about people fuck them,0
What would you want your parents to change about what they do?,0
"Youre not the only one crying today, I hate today.",1
I share your thoughts. My therapist suggested that the reason why I could be so thin is because my body burns so much energy in my brain because it is constantly going around around. It's such a pain &gt;: It would be nice for once to be calm.,1
"As that was your first ever boyfriend, I understand you missing him. If I ever get a first girlfriend, I would miss her too. However, this guy did terrible things to you. There are other guys out there who will love you and treat you with respect. Good luck",1
I'm convinced that I was born depressed. As a child I cried more so than other children my age. I still cry and I'm in my mid\-thirties. I think I did read somewhere that some people are born with a gene that makes them more susceptible to depression but it doesn't necessarily mean they will have depression when they get older.,1
"Highs and lows, just the cycle of depression, the key is understanding what set you down that low, a bad test score, relationship issues, new work load, money issues. Then once you can identify your triggers you can make some plans to avoid them or change what made you drop in the first place",0
I know if this is comforting but there is no reason why. You just were born. I get the same thought as you often. I think of how there is much more net suffering than net joy in life. But honestly it just feels that way since been more severely depressed (just a couple of months) I have hope that at some point i can get back to feeling better. It may take a few more months even. But even just thinking back to how I used to feel makes me realize that there is hope.,1
"Please don't. I know you hurt. I do, too. But we both still have something left to offer to the world.",1
"Genetics are a bitch. I have depression and anxiety throughout my entire family. No one batted an eye when I told my mom I wanted to kill myself in 10th grade. It was like ahh she's arrived at the depression, we've been waiting for this. Like it was puberty or something. I don't want to die anymore but everyday is a struggle for happiness and taming my anxiety feels like a full time job. You're not alone my friend.",1
"Thats why i hated high school, the person who sits alone(at least at my old high school) always ends up getting made fun of and laughed at, its ridiculous and stupid. I was always one to ask people who sat alone if they wanted to sit with me and my friends. I can't understand why they would make fun of someone. Hang in there man.",1
"Why Bro? Bad year i know, me too. But why? Have a nice days ;)",1
"You pick yourself up and you tell your partner how you're feeling. If there's nothing that can be done to save the relationship, tell your partner. Remember that you loved them once and really you don't want them being with someone who doesn't love them either.",0
What happened on Nov 28th?,0
"it *probably* depends on the state (edit: what state in the US). being 14, you are going to be tethered to your parent/guardian legally. the therapist/counselor/psychologist will be legally required to tell your guardians of anything that serves of specific risk. for example, i told my therapist that i was suicidal and he had to contact my mother and explain the basics of the situation. for self harm, im not sure exactly how/if the information would be disclosed by the therapist/counselor/psychologist to your parents.. but im assuming if you are physically hurting yourself to a GREAT EXTENT then yes, it would most likely be disclosed. im 18 now, and started seeing my on-campus(university) therapist and psychiatrist at the beginning of the school year, where i was 17. it sucks not being in control of your life, but what can you do, you know? if getting to see a therapist is an issue, i would recommend asking to talk to your doctor/pediatrician in private (during a normal check-up) and say tht youve had symptoms of depression/anxiety and you'd like to have some help talking to your parent about getting help. if it's not an issue of talking to your parent/guardian, then what's the worry? if you cant see a doctor, a school counselor could help you have this conversation with your parent! or even a supportive teacher that you trust. i went through a very similar situation when i was younger, and very much regret not being more persistent about getting help when i needed it. it mght not go away, and with school only getting harder and more stressful as you age, it's *really hard* to deal with all this emotional baggage. everyone deserves to feel the best that they can. you dont want to suffer anymore and someday you wont! feel free to pm me, i'd be happy to be your pen-pal through all this &lt;3",1
The good is worth it! Hang in there! You can get through this because you're stronger than this! You can make it through cause the good will be worth it! Lots of love!,1
"You will be fine! I would suggest, sit down with a glass of water and do anything too intensive. Let us know how you feel later on. :)",1
"I've had the same experience with them, but I think the problem was that I wasn't opening up to my therapist. Don't give up just yet!",1
"Currently? No. But 12 days ago I drank until I blacked out just trying to forget my feelings and forget everything until morning. My subconscious, drunk brain had other plans. I tried to hang myself from a bridge but luckily was too drunk to execute it. I ended up with broken bones in both my feet, a required 5 day stay in a hospital behavior and addiction unit, and no memory of what I had done or even ever feeling suicidal. 12 days sober and have accepted that I have a binge drinking problem. You can only drown your sorrows for so long before they explode outward - one way or another. I am happy to help any way I can.",1
"I just started smoking weed. Not to get high just to feel ok. And it's been working great!!! I still feel generally down, but without all the bullshit toxic thoughts and stuff.",0
"I feel you. I just lost a battle on HS because of my stupid wifi connection and makes me want to die. Why am I so unlucky? Why always me and not others? I mean, it occasionally happens, but I struggle even on videogames now. It feels so fucking horrible to not be good in what you used to be good. Depression sucks. I feel you.",1
"been feeling it all the time for years now, its like tried so hard to make it better but it go away",1
I used to be very hurt by that-- but now I just focus on how the relationship feels when we're in person. I may be the last to text but if we can get together and it feels like we haven't missed a beat-- I'm cool.,1

You are seen! We care about you here. Its not always a booming because everyone is so sad themselves but we look out for eachother here,1
I'm so happy for you! This is definitely a good sign.,1
"Hey man, wanna talk before you do that? I wanna know what's on your mind. I'm just curious and I actually DO care. Please just don't do something that's permanent for an issue that is temporary. Message me",1
"Hello, I can be friend",1
I hate being told that. Do people think we haven't thought about it before?,0
"Remember what your mother did to you the other night? That is what is going on, I imagine. Bed beckons but you won't find comfort there. Get out of the house, seek company. You won't be much fun but we are social animals, we are programmed to calibrate our mood meter with reference to others. Hang out with healthy people, your mood will lift somewhat. Isolate and it can go into free fall.",0

happy birthday! hope you have a chance to celebrate yourself,1
"You go from momentary relief to slipping and losing your footing while clawing your way back to the opposite direction you downward spiraled in, which may or may not avoid the eternal pit that yearns for an alternate option being sanctuary.",0
"Sorry to hear you have been going through a rough time. Emotions can be hard to control and anger can be an easy out. It lets you feel powerful, in control of things. In therapy they teach you to sit-down often and sort through your emotions. What emotion are you experiencing right now? How do you identify it? What caused you to feel like this? What steps can you make to prevent this feeling? Try to walk yourself through some of these exercises. They might help you better understand your emotions so that you can control them in the future.",1
"What are your goals? Take away any kind of emotional association you have and focus on your goals and just do it. Most people like going to the gym, but most people like to be unhealthy. Just do it.",1
This is too real for me.,1
the thing about suicide is that harder to do it yourself. Sometimes me and my friends wish we could die by accident so we have to take the responsibility of doing it ourselves. All the things that happen after to our or friends is a scary thought too. Those are things that make it hard for me to kill myself. Maybe you relate,0
"Can you just get one of those packages of pre-washed spinach and add those to your sandwiches as a start? Take what you have working for you and try to cram as many nutrients in as possible. Spinach is a good choice because it's pretty nutrient dense as opposed to lettuce, and it's easy to add to stuff. You can even grab a can on minestrone (or any other type) soup, heat it up and dump a bunch of spinach into it to boost the vegetable content. My go to recently has been a spinach salad with goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Maybe some day I'll get fancy and add onions or peppers or whatever to make it a real salad, but at this point, it's better than the grilled cheese by itself or whatever else I'm eating. Baby steps, man. Baby steps.",0
"When I felt this way, I came to the conclusion that I didn't know who I was without these feelings. I didn't know what I liked anymore, would I be empty without this sadness? That sort of thought process, it was a lot of fear that drove me away from help. It's natural to be afraid of things changing. But when you feel ready to, these changes are for the better.",1
"I wouldn't want to give my depression to anyone else, it's too much to deal with myself and giving it to someone else would make me feel even lower.",0
"i like the statement, suffering is just part of life. i believe this to be true. i think we actually LEARN, not cognitively, but emotionally, that sometimes many of us just go thru these spells of suffering/depression. a solid 10 years here! just in the past 2 years am i starting to feel KINDA like a NORMAL person again",0
"You're not alone. The few really close friends I've had have all moved overseas, and moved on with their lives. I'm all alone in the city I grew up in. It's a surreal feeling. For each day that passes I feel more and more antisocial, and it only gets harder to reach out to people, and the more time I spend alone, the less I have to say to the people around me. It's a vicious circle and I don't know how to escape it.",1
"I have that feeling too... but then I read it can be one of the symptoms of PTSD, so I really don't know what to think about it",1
"It seems I feel that way all the time too, but my anxiousness goes up and down.",1
"At some level I still think it is a choice. A million different choices. For me at least. On my bad days/weeks/months/years I am so paralyzed by anxiety and depression and apathy for living that I sleep all day and avoid everything. I avoid life. I want do die, but am too lazy to do anything about it. When I take initiative to do things, work on a project, clean stuff, I feel so much better. I loose myself in my task and all those heavy feelings of hopelessness stay away for awhile. Maybe it is just me, maybe I am just lazy. Idk, but that is my life experience.",1
So many feels. Here to chat if you'd like. I'm going through a similar thing at the moment and it's tearing me apart.,1
"on it right now, but I be much help as I have been known to be treatment resistant and for me it does about the same as the rest as in it more so numbs me to all feeling but is not as strong as others in that way so i still sunk low quite a bit, but on like 7 or 8 different meds in the past 6 years so my experience mean to much, I hope it works great for you though. If you mind me asking what is the dosage your on for them?",1
That's every holiday for me bud.,0
"Yeah. I'm afraid of a painful death. I'm afraid of dying itself. Does my consiousness just stop? Does it feel like before I was born? Is there something afterward? Both heaven and hell sound terrible. I don't want to stop having my body, it's like my home. But then at the same time I hate it here. Daily conversations are robotic and empty. People are rude and selfish. Everyone is obsessed with fast cars and big houses and parties... but none of it means anything. I'm just so tired. I want to run away and build my own hut in the forest.",1
I'm sorry you are feeling this way. We are here for you.,1
"There are actually some studies that support this: depressed people are more likely to correctly assess probabilities and risk/reward in many situations. However, we also have documentable thought process issues, the primary being black and white thinking, all-or-nothing. So I don't think we get to claim to be the sane ones. ;)",0
"The most painless way is to keep living. Nothing is more painful than a beautiful life taken from us. Please please please let someone help you tell the people you care about, give them a chance to help or you will rip a void through their hearts. I don't know what your going through but I know you don't wish this pain upon anyone especially those you love. If I could carry this for you I would and my heart is already breaking just thinking about how you might feel. Don't do it.",1
"I can get that, but the feeling's only temporary, isn't it? An hour or two maybe depending on what exactly, but still. Those things always run out and I find myself being broke not long later, having to lend or beg relatives, yadda yadda yadda. I hate it, but love it at the same time because that always seems to pay off. Sure, I don't have the right mindset for this thing - drugs are bad, and so on and so on but whatever works works. Just make sure it works and doesn't make it worse is my advice.",1
missed you a lot! Are you doing well?,0
I don't think that's weird at all. Just don't forget that you're still the same person you were before you changed how you think of yourself.,1
tried it personally. One friend told me whenever he does shrooms he depressed for at least a month afterwards. But bad trips are also a risk.,1
isn't this me in a bubble,0
"Happy birthday love, have a great one!",1

"Oh I know. In my opinion the true reason that you, me and about 90% of people with depression feels the way you portrayed in this post is because out of all those people who are support. no one really understands on a deep, emotional, and philosophical level how this disorder ruins your life and makes it miserably painful. The ONLY way you know is if you have experienced it yourself. Once you get truly depressed you enter the void. Some people are only in that void for some brief time, while clinically depressed people like ourselves live in this void. That support group doesn't speak our language. That's the fucking problem. They don't know the void. They can only read about the void, but they don't live in it. The support group approaches depression in the same way that males know what it's like to go through childbirth (no this is not a political push either way). It's just stating, THEY DONT but they can read all about it and try to imagine the pain, but they can never truly feel it. The subjective nature of emotions and life makes it beyond Fucking difficult to find people who know what you are truly talking about at your personal level.",1
"I am 31 yrs old and am in college myself. I dropped out during my first college career due to, you guessed it, mental health issues. College is hard. LIFE is hard. But honey, there are people who love you. People who care way less about your college degree and debt than they do about your happiness. Look into your university's mental health services. Counseling is a sympathetic ear who will NEVER downplay things bringing you stress. I've been depressed. I've been suicidal. The worst part is the sincere feeling that nothing will EVER get better. Well, I want to tell you that IT WILL. While there's life, there's hope. Please PM me if you need support. I've been where you are. It sucks, but it can be overcome.",1

"This may be a tough concept to accept, but you should be happy that other's have that something you lack. Be honest with yourself, do you see all of those relationships your friends have lasting for decades? Finding love is complex. I wouldn't say you're wasting your time doing nothing. I've seen this too many times, where people spend days after days trying to find the one. That just now how it works. Although it is true that if you don't look, you won't find in most cases. You shouldn't fear not finding love. 'Cause that's just not how it works. I wouldn't say love finds you either, that's also not how it works. I wouldn't ponder too much about not finding the one or love. Time will tell, it will come. During that time, try to be alright with yourself by being just yourself. You want to be with someone because you want to be with them, not because you fear being lonely. Give it time. Talk to your friends. Enjoy yourself.",1

I don't know how old you are, but all the time and resources that went into raising you and feeding you and just growing. I feel it's a shame to waste so much.

In my experience, the type of care you get is less important than the connection you feel with the provider. So I over think it too hard. Instead, put that energy towards finding the right person.

Most teachers would be happy to have you reach out, plus by being in communication with them, they'll be there to help keep your motivation up. Work out a plan for each class on how to raise grades, maybe see if you can stay before or after school with one of them to have them monitor you while you work. I hate to say this, but school academics come over sports. If time mangement is becoming hard, maybe ask if you can lower yourself from captian position. Freshmen year is easiest for most, so you might want to get help now to save yourself from only deciding to change say in junior year. I'm sorry your mental illness is having an affect like this, but the first step is admitting you want help which you've done so good job! I'll be rooting for you.",1
"Music had always affected my moods depending on what I listen to. When I need a boost of happiness or motivation I like to listen to Alexander desplat or Hans zimmer or James horner. Honestly, I am just a huge orchestra person and, since it doesn't have lyrics, I can pretend it's the soundtrack to my life and feel more courageous to get moving. There's also another user (I wish I could remember where or who it was) but they suggested doing at least one thing whenever you get up to go pee or get water. Then, you can push it to doing two things when you feel more motivated. Please be kind and have patience with yourself. Depression is an ongoing war with many battles. Celebrate your wins and don't berate yourself when you're not doing as well as you wish. Take baby steps you can easily accomplish and grow from there.

"Definitely. I want my ex back more than anything, we broke up over a year ago, she's got a kid with someone else now and it hurts a lot, but it was my fault. I wasn't the nicest person to be around sometimes, I did a lot of good in the relationship, but a lot of bad too. I'm not proud of it, I'm ashamed of it, I regret it all, I hate myself over the things I've done. I think that's what makes the breakup worse, knowing that it was my fault, that I could have saved it if I had just stayed on my medication. I keep trying to convince myself she broke my heart, but I broke both mine and hers through my actions. Still doesn't make it any less painful and I wish I could just end it all right now.",1
You try to make things better. And try. And try.,0
"I try to cope by trying to keep my own goals from the past that were broken, alongside those i may make in the current time, intact for myself. Whether or not that can happen or if it's meant to be for me, i don't and honestly can't know, unless and until i get there from still trying. I am living, but not alive -- there is a difference; I'm trying to find completion for that void. I try to accept myself and my flaws -- even some of the current ones i want gone as i progress towards that. I still fight myself over that and/or other things at times. But i still try to accept and understand. I just keep going. For the sake of something i still believe in somewhere out there that might be befitting of me, as i want it. If it's there, i must get to it -- i must have it. At the same time, i must better myself until i am who and what I've always wanted to be, both in and out. The sense of failure and futility are always there -- i just keep trying to keep them level and not overwhelm me. I try to do things for myself i thought i had from others. Things i would truly want done to me by others. But there's nobody. I got used to it. Despite still wanting the opposite in my own humble way. I just think of what who might actually still exist out there, think and feel if i weren't doing this, willingly, to keep pushing. I keep trying to believe that regardless, i deserve things my way. After everything especially. That it can't all be for naught. I've yet to see that. That's why I'm still going for the future. Even if its path got shattered long-ago, many-a-time. I hope this helps.",1
I feel you. When I wasn't diagnosed but was obviously depressed (looking back now) I was in denial and felt ashamed. I always said I feel depressed and not I am depressed,1
"Hi Friend, Someone will always it worse. This is true. But, I think that you should draw strength from the fact not that others have it worse, but that you know there is better. I certainly understand the feeling of the teeter totter between living in hell and trying too hard. Don't let the fear of being not down to Earth shackle you my friend. Reach out and grab for what makes you feel alive, because there is far more uncertainty in sitting back and watching. I truly feel that your reactions to other's lives highlights your ability to empathize and live. Harvest that energy for its beauty and not its sadness. Stay strong.",1
What happened? Tell us. We'll listen.,1
"I'm not entirely certain what reaction you're getting, but I hope you'll give those around you a little slack if they can't be as openly receptive and caring as you need at first. I'm sort of the designated problem solver in my circle, so quite a few of my friends come to me for advice and sympathy. It's never, never a burden. Instead, it's an honor. They trust me with their secrets, their problems, and value my opinion enough to ask for it. Reverse the situation. Aren't you glad when someone comes to you? The thing is, not everyone is built for that. Especially, I have found, it can sort of weird people out when the Rock, the Stable One, the One Person In This Messed Up World Who Has Their Stuff Together needs help. I mean, here's the person they go to and they rely on when they need support... and that person needs support. Suddenly you're not Superman anymore and it can be a bit disconcerting. Perhaps try introducing A problem at a time, slowly, and seeing if they can get used to you also being a normal human with issues. Good luck!!",1
"My parents were the type who didn't believe in mental illness, it was just me being lazy and antisocial. Until I left home for college, I never thought I had mental problems, I just thought I was just a shitty person who couldn't do anything.

"What's stupid about them specifically, if I may ask?",0
What? As long as it's not directly physically hurting another person you should always do whatever makes you happy. And if it's suicide then that's not wrong. For some people suicide is the answer. To act like every single person ever will one day find a reason to want to live is ignorant and idiotic at best. Is there a chance you will? Of course. But to many people it's not worth continuing to live with something that they've dealt with for years at a chance of having it magically get cured.,1
"Cutting the topside of my arms hurt and bled but they clotted pretty quickly. Please use a sterile blade if you're going to cut yourself, and don't go any deeper than just the surface skin. Take it from me as someone who has used self-harm, an infection is not the sort of pain that helps with emotional relief! I also recommend other methods, there are plenty out there that can cause some pretty gnarly pain but are far, far safer than cutting. Are there any taps in your house that have overly hot water? Boiling water shouldn't be used as it will scald and is just as prone to infection and other nasties as cutting, so just try clenching a fist under the regular hot water for a few seconds. On the other end of the scale I found the grabing an ice cube and squeezing as tight as I could helped! I thought it would just make my hand feel numb, but it creates a localised, sharp unbearable sensation that works wonders to distract me.",1
"I make a handwritten to-do list and then see what thing on the list strikes me as the least difficult to do. And then I do it, and don't think about anything but that task until it's done. Sometimes having a concrete list helps the anxiety/depression pass, and sometimes it just makes my day less overwhelming, so I'm at least able to get through the easiest and/or most important tasks.",1
I'm sorry your situation at home is so difficult. Do you have anyone in your life whom you trust enough to talk to about how you're feeling?,1
"I do. It's like you're on pause, but your problems aren't..",1
"I feel the same way, I am single and have problems socially. So being alone makes my motivation worse and makes me really depressed. I am failing most of my classes this semester and don't seem to have motivation to make a rebound. Just know that theres people out there going through what your going through and I am here to at least give you assurance that you aren't alone in situations like this. I don't like it when people tend to say just force yourself to be motivated, but I am just lazy and hopeless at this point. I wish the best for you and I actually was on pill medication for this sort of stuff at a point, so if you got questions about that or anything in general maybe I can make use of myself and help someone out who needs it more than I do.",1
"Yeah, but at the same time, some of us also deny that that's the reason for our unhappiness. After all, how pathetic is it to want something and be sad because we can't have it? The human condition is weird.",1
"Everything is pointless and hopeless I was born broken and forever unable to feel happiness please end me now I can't do this anymore. I had to let that out. Sorry. I hope you find meaning in your days, OP. I've given up myself, but I really, really hate to see other people feel this way. Life is so hard. I things get better and easier for you.",1

"Well look, I see your confusion, but not really asking a question. not really giving yourself a chance to construct something that will give you a leg to stand on when it comes to your own consideration. asking these rhetorical questions, like, what? supposed to have kids? supposed to do something Those things are up to you, but if you find value in them then you keep looking for validation there. It sounds like trying to work backwards from what you think makes other lives worth living, what you think validates their lives. But a vexed approach. Those things may enrich a experience and situations, but they confer meaning and significance in and of a cart before the horse thing. We get value from lists of attributes, you just plug in these arbitrary conditions and get a happy human that lives an engaging life. And, more importantly, you fixate on those attributes and dream that those magical little things are what stand between you and your sense of fulfillment and worth. You have to start smaller and construct that sense of purpose and wellbeing piece by piece. You have to make little investments in your immediate world that contribute something to that.",0

"Getting a job is pretty stressful when you're feeling down. It doesn't help that sometimes finding a job, or the right job at least, is pretty stressful itself. What I found is that volunteering is a great stepping stone on the path to getting a job and being more comfortable around people. Volunteer gigs are pretty easy to find and land, and the people who also volunteer tend to be nice people as well. If that's something interesting to you, call up your local churches and ask about volunteering opportunities. As an added bonus, volunteering work looks good on some job applications.",1

When I've described this to my therapist and psychiatrist, they challenge me on it -- you talk about good things, don't you feel happy when those happen? -- but I know the difference. It is very much like an old, lost friend. I actually might use that metaphor in therapy this week.",1

I now have an amphetamine addiction and recently tried meth for the first time neglecting my girlfriend, stealing from my dad just to be high alone... all to fill the void Drugs make everything worse, but sometimes I feel like they are the only things that put a little bit of excitement into my body.",1

Now just think about what all your friends and family will think once you are gone... they will be blaming themselves forever because they will feel like they are at fault because they didnt help you when you needed it most. Again idk what going through, but think of how many people are going through as worse or worse than you and still tough it out and make it through.",1
"I day dream about death sometimes, but honestly I want to die but not just by myself or an accident. I want to die doing something good. I don't want my suicide to be just a loss of a life but more of a loss for a good cause. For example dieing while fighting for my country would be a good way.",1
"Can you talk about whats going on in your head? Maybe if you get it out, it will be a little more sorted? I'm sorry it's so overwhelming right now. Someone loves you, they just don't know how to show it the right way, right now.",1
"You know what kind of answer you'll get here. I know this is your state of mind right now, but realize that it is a state of mind. You want to take some kind of action to change your circumstances and right now suicide seems like the only option. That's because taking some kind of action to change your circumstances helps lift your brain out of its depression. Suddenly you don't feel completely hopeless. Maybe life can be better after all... Except you'd be having that thought as you're dying. That would be terrible. So you have to find some other way to turn things around.",1
"Saw mine coming a mile away. Suffering from anxiety and depression, and life circumstances kept becoming more and more difficult. Job was going to shit and stressing me out. Money was becoming a bigger and bigger problem at home. Was getting very little sleep between stress and my son not sleeping at night. One day it became too much. Started crying and having a panic attack. Didn't stop until I drank myself to sleep. The next day I was still struggling to function due to feeling incredibly and persistently overwhelmed.

Sometimes I feel like I almost like being depressed... weird huh?,1
"Same here, big exam Tuesday and i barely read anything. Usually i could get my ass out of bed to study but this year i just can't. Maybe go take a little or long walk, been doing it for three days now and at least i don't feel like shit. Your mileage may vary, tho",1

"I was diagnosed with moderate to severe depression while in undergrad. It's been a long journey but in essence I've gotten control of it through controlling risk factors (diet, sleep, exercise), as well as recognizing risk factors (such as social events). I've had a great support network too. There are times though that I can feel the dark clouds approaching but they're much easier to handle, and the lows are more evened out to what I guess would be considered a normal level.",1

I've been trying to write a journal for the same reason. While it did seem helpful by letting me vent and understand myself better it ultimately didn't help me much so I stopped because it was very time consuming.,1
I ask myself the same thing. Do I really have a mental illness or is it all a sham to justify my weak pathetic demeanor? Why do you think your weak?,1

"For me, it's because I think I'm a broken bottle of poison. All I do is hurt those around me, so I keep away both spirit and body. Those who care enough to try and help fix me end up getting hurt, and in the end, I'm still just a vial of poison. All I'm capable of doing is hurting others. I'm guessing this type of mindset sorta leaked into everything I do, so I tell myself not only do they do not want to be with me, they are better off for it.",1
Oh god yes. I know this feeling. There is nothing good about me. I got rejected by a guy a couple months ago that I was sure liked me too. He doesn't even know it but he made the best decision for himself. It would be the worst decision of his life if he started talking to me again. I'd feel so guilty letting somebody deal with my shit.,1

"That whole best years of your life thing, at least in my opinion, is a load of hogwash. Best years? Body going through changes? Trying to figure out your first relationships? Stuck in school all day? Drama everywhere? Restricted in everything you want to do? Inexperienced enough to not know what you really want to do? I could go on... HS sucks. With very few exceptions, the only people I know who consider HS the best years are people who are completely and totally miserable adults who are looking back with rose-colored glasses at a time when their parents paid for everything. College is better for most people, but the partying and crap is highly overrated once you're old enough to look back a bit. I don't know anyone who misses that stuff. But what are the best years? I think once you hit your mid-20s things really start to look up. Odds are, your career is at least starting to actually materialize, you aren't as emotionally immature anymore and things don't bother you like they used to, and generally speaking the odds are that things are more stable overall. Don't sell your future short--you'll look back and realize there's a lot of crap in HS/college that you'll be glad to have behind you!!",1

"We have all kinds of urges, and I treat depression like that. Something to ignore most of the time, and constantly defy to prove myself that those thoughts are wrong. I have come to terms with it and am not wrestling with a monster anymore. I got him in a cage and he's my bitch. Woof. Woof",0

"To answer your question, I'm actually feeling alright today. Had an existential crisis last night and probably would have ended up killing myself or at the very least cutting myself if it wasn't for my dog licking my hand as I layed in bed crying myself to sleep (she's NEVER an affectionate dog, it took me a minute to even realise that she was actually licking my hand and I wasn't imagining shit). Thanks, Charlie. Anyways, for me depression is like absolute insanity. It's not just sadness or feeling like killing myself every other week. Just pure insanity. The best example I can give is probably two years ago, seventh grade. That was probably the lowest I had ever been. Every night when I went to sleep, I'd stay up on my phone. Not because I wanted to be, because it kept me from going to sleep and having the same nightmares I had every night. And then I'd look at the time, which by now was probably about 12 AM, realise how absolutely sad and pathetic I was and turn on some emo music, usually being something like Set it Off's I'll Sleep When I'm Dead and listen to that as I (literally) sadistically laugh and cry myself to sleep. Some nights, that kind of stuff never happened. I'd have a peaceful sleep. Some nights I'd stay up all night debating whether I should text the suicide hotline, doing so, and it being no help whatsoever. So I'd get, maybe six hours of sleep at most. Before I'm woken up and have to get ready for school. How am I woken up? By my parents during the best part of my dream or the most peaceful part of my nightmare. Which already started my day off terribly. Then for an hour I'd be in the bathroom once again listening to emo music as I let the shower water run. My favourite songs to listen to were usually just about anything by Hollywood Undead. Not something a twelve year old should be listening to, sure. But it was a way to cope with my depression. As I listen to those songs, once again sadistically laughing at my own pain and often times end up cutting myself. I never cut myself deep, I was far to afraid of doing that. But... I enjoyed seeing the blood come out. I didn't cut for any sort of high or release of pain. It was sort of hard to explain. I was never addicted to cutting, I could stop or start whenever I wanted. Sometimes stopping for months at a time, but seeing the blood, made me feel happy. If you could have seen my eyes, especially when I cut myself, you wouldn't have seen any traces of a twelve year old. You'd see an insane person desperately trying to grasp on to the last straw of sanity, but nothing else. Some days I'd debate whether I should do a sort of murder-suicide thing. Or at the very least murder those who have caused me pain and suffering. Sometimes I'd have very and scarily elaborate plans on how I'd trick, kidnap, or kill my family. Things that you'd never expect from a twelve year old. But quite frankly, I might have physically been twelve, but my depression had probably aged and matured me way faster. The ride to school was probably the most traumatic for me. The ride was only about ten minutes (five minutes to school, five minutes in the carpool line). But those ten minutes were full of tests streaming down my face, me punching myself or ripping my hair out, or destroying my notebooks or pencils. Sometimes because I just really didn't want to go to school. Sometimes because my social anxiety got the best of me. Sometimes for reasons I don't even know. Me and my grandma would usually sit at the front of the school for about an hour or two, I'm sitting there trying to find a way to hurt myself because I'm angry, but don't want to let my anger out on her, and she's crying because she's absolutely lost on how to help me. I'd usually end up getting to school about a good three hours late. In school, I don't remember anything. Maybe it's because I was just walking around the school like a robot. Class for an hour, find your next class, repeat. In class, I'd have my head down in a book (not paying attention to the teacher whatsoever), I'd be mindlessly reciting the emo songs I listen to in my head, or I'd be talking to my friend AIDEN. (Yes, his name is in all caps). What I do definitely remember is hating all of my peers. Hell, I still hate them. It's not my hatred for them itself. It's just I can't stand how immature, idiotic, and stupid they were. Like who the hell goes around sticking Tide pods in their mouths for views on social media? Or who thinks it's funny to go around telling people to kill themselves because you heard your favourite edgy YouTuber say it and now you think it's hilarious to do so. Or why do you think it's cool and okay to curse every five seconds and use the N-word? Or why do you think that because you saw Kim Kardashian half naked in some photo shoot that you can show up to school with hardly any clothes on or sag and talk about fucking whores because your favourite rapper said it in their newest song? Act your own god damn age, quit trying to act like someone three times your age while being as immature as a kindergartener. More on AIDEN: AIDEN sort of just appeared out of nowhere. I don't know when or why I came up with him, I just sort of did. I'm not schizophrenic, he was 100% my own voice talking back to me in my head, but I enjoyed pretending to have someone to talk to. Someone who walked around with me everyday, knew exactly what I was thinking, and could relate to me all the time. Someone who (though was just my own voice), talked me out of suicide many times back in 7th grade. But slowly I started treating AIDEN a lot more like a real person. To the point where I could have easily been mistaken as someone with schizophrenia. At home I'd just go into my room and basically lock myself in. My door was never locked, my parents could come in and out as they pleased, but I would just hand out under the covers all day. I didn't want to see light, light didn't want to see me. I didn't bother with homework. I figured, I fail, I fail. I really had just given up with life at that point. The only reason why I hadn't killed myself was probably because I was too sad and lazy to bother trying. Occasionally I'd talk to AIDEN or watch YouTube or something, but most times I ended up listening to hypnosis. Hypnosis for me was like a way to escape real life. Like meditation, but instead of being left alone with my sad and depressing thoughts, I could listen to someone else. At first it was a nice little escape, but then it more or less because an addiction. An odd strange one that I'd never be able to explain to anyone, but an addiction none the less. I'd try to listen to hypnosis any time I could even if that meant going into my room away from family to listen to it. It kind of gave me the same high that cutting, smoking, drugs, or porn give other people. Even though it was just hypnosis, it really did become unhealthy. Before I knew it, it was time for me to go to bed. And then the whole cycle would repeat itself over and over and over and over and over again. It was the same routine, same schedule, same insanity over and over again. This sounds like more is going on than just depression, right? Like some other underlying mental illness. But this is all depression and a bit of social anxiety. No MPD, no schizophrenia, no bipolar disorder, I'm not a psychopath or sociopath. This was all thanks to my depression. No one actually knew how bad my mental state was. I never told anyone. I was diagnosed with depression and put on meds, but if anyone really knew how bad it was, I likely truly would have been put in a mental health hospital. This is where the most insane part was, since being on my meds, I'm a lot more stable. But I miss being the way I was. Even though they were supposed to, my meds didn't help my depression. It really just made me more stable. Now without AIDEN or cutting myself or the enjoyment of listening to emo music as I sadistically laugh and cry at the same time, I just feel empty. Though I was completely fucked up, it was still fun a times to laugh at how much I hate myself and my life. Now I can't do those things anymore. It's like being insane was a big part of me and my depression. The insanity itself was taken away, but the depression was still left. Now there's just a big, empty, dark hole.",1

"I was getting better around last November after 2 years of being a shut in. I got a job, moved out and on with my life, and was doing good. I started to decline about 4 months ago. I'm back to where I was. I moved back. No more job. No more new friends. The only thing that keeps me going is that this right now won't be forever. It's for now and it's so debilitating. I leave my bed to use the restroom, grab something to eat back in bed, and thats it for last week at my just getting here lowest points. And over time the time spent like this will get shorter and the time spent on that high curve will go longer and farther. I don't feel that in any way. I'm lucky to have had a decade of therapy to make me feel like I know it tho. Doesn't change the feeling at all but gives me a shred of hope to hang onto. I'm really sorry you feel that way mate. Some people don't do well with that kinda energy but there are a lot who will not care too and help you with their energy. My dad is neutral and doesn't care, but can't really help. My mother won't even be around me when I'm down. Even told me she can't stand it. Just having the 2 people I have right now for when I am down tho helps me a lot.

"Do your parents tell you that you're a failure? My mom and dad both did that to me for a while. I'm 16. I used to be depressed over my bad grades and I had this constant anxious feeling that my life was over because of these bad grades and I would amount to nothing. Then all of a sudden one day, I noticed that bad grades in high school aren't the end of the world. It might have been because I moved out of my Dad's place and I didn't have to hear him call me a failure anymore. Either way, I became happy again. Then I met her. A nice girl who was my age. She had a pretty face, we had a ton of classes together, and she thought I was really funny. I was able to open up to her. I think (I know) I fell in love with her. She had a boyfriend though. He's a shitty person. He's high all the time and he always flirts around with other girls. I really thought she would break it off with him and find her way to my arms and I'd be the happiest guy in the world. That didn't happen. I became desperate. I began to have a drinking problem because of it. One night while very drunk I texted her a bunch of things about my depression. I don't think she cares about me anymore. Now I find myself drunk and alone for the umpteenth time wondering how I let myself get depressed again.  Basically what I wanna say to you is: your life's not over, it's just beginning. Whatever it is that makes you feel like a failure is probably a problem that is possible to overcome. Just focus on you and don't let other people get in your way and bring you down like I did. Don't let anyone else determine your happiness. Control your life. You can do it.",1
"But then it can be even worse.. If we honestly, truly act like we feel 100% of the time, there really isn't much hope to establish any real connection to anyone.. It's really fucking difficult to wear a mask all the time, but at least it's marginally better that being alone all the time, isn't it? Most people don't want to associate with someone who is severely depressed and deathly anxious, and I can't even blame them.. If I do act like how I feel, I'm probably a nightmare to be around, because there's an aura of sadness and hopelessness that surrounds me. How can I expect anyone to approach me? Even if there is someone who does, it would be crazy to expect them to completely accept a miserable wreck like me. I mean, I can't just take and not give.. And then there's the people who act all smug and give you all that fucking moronic rose-tinted glasses shit with an air of superiority, a la /r/wowthanksimcured, and you feel even worse. It does feel like shit, but I've managed to construct separate personalities for interacting with my family and for anything job-related, because at a workplace, nobody gives a fuck if you're rotting on the inside due to over a decade of depression, anxiety, and self-hatred. So, while I wish I could agree with what you say, it's just not applicable..",1
"I'm game and need to vent so here goes... I was verbally, physically and emotionally abused for as long as I can recall. Since you asked about emotional abuse I will focus solely on that. I was blamed constantly for everything that was wrong with the family. My mother told me this numerous times after she and my father would have huge, physically violent fights that started over events that had nothing to do with me. I was constantly told If you had a brain you would be dangerous. by my mother. Not after I'd done anything, not after a stupid act or action on my part but just in passing. This was my mother's assesment of me and she told me this frequently. I was tested, determined to have a high IQ, placed in gifted and talented classes and made to suffer for it by narcissistic, superficial, egotistical mother for my entire life. If I vot an A I was told it was because the work was too easy for me, if I got a B it was because I was lazy and never applied myself. I would constantly be accused of thinking I was So smart. Nothing I ever did or attempted to do was good enough, there was always some flaw in it. I only received criticism, never any praise. In 4th grade I had lovely long hair, my mother decided I should have it all cut off. She took me to a beauty school and had them cut all of my hair off, a boy cut, they shaved the back of my neck. My mom cried afterward and said she was crying because The haircut showed how ugly I was. The next week we were going into our small town to pick up this giant fancy framed picture for our living room, My mom made me walk on the opposite side of the street after we got out of the car. She said, I don't want to be seen with you and have people know you are my daughter. My mother really values externak beauty. I was a skinny unremarlable child, I never forgot the other side of the street incident, I had to look at the damn framed picture that we picked up that day until I moved away from home and got married at age 19. Every time I saw it I thought of that day. Years of torture. I was a divorced single mother, my ex never paid a dime, not any of the support we were supposed to receive. I worked two jobs to support us. I never received any financial help from anyone. I crafted a nice career for myself and tried to be a good mom and a good person. I never drank, never did drugs or ran around or went wild or got in any trouble. But my mother was/is ashamed of me and made/makes sure to let me know it. Anyone she talks about to me she lets me know how successful their children are, how wealthy they are and how proud the parents are. My mom told me one day how disappointed she was with how I'd turned out, how she always thought I'd be someone when I grew up. She said she'd hoped I would've grown up to marry a doctor or lawyer or someone important. I told her I was someone. At the time I was an online database adminstrator with a nationally recognized nonprofit but to my mother I was an embarrassment, a nothing and a nobody. My mother's father, my grandfather was one of the only people in my life that was always kind to me, he treated me like I was special and had value. My mother knew I adored him and she hated that he liked me. After he died she insisted on telling me horrible things about him saying she wanted me to know what kind of man the grandfather I worshipped really was and that I should not feel special that some thing like him tolerated me better than most. Right after I was divorced, I was not yet employed full time and very poor. I was visifing my parents at their huge house in the country. My mother started bitching about how poor I was, I had not asked her or dad for a dime and I was not there to eat. Mom started talking about dying, asked me if I had a sill, etc.. Mom told me I better not die because she did not want to have to spend her money on a funeral for me, and she said not that anyone would show up at a funeral for me anyway. She also told me that she'd always thought of me as a living abortion, since my birth. She was going nuts, yelling and spitting. She told me she bet I was so poor, such a failure that I probably could not even afford feminine products. I got my purse to leave, opened it and hurled a few tampons at her, as I told her, wrong bitch. My father blocked the front door, and tried to make me apologise to my mother. I had to threaten to call the police before he would let me go. After my father passed away my mother called, she said she needed to ask me something. Then mom said, Did you ever think or get the feeling that your father really loved you or cared about you? I told my mom that yes, yes I did. That dad was a fifties guy and although he may not have ever been emotionally demonstrative I thought he did love and care about me. He has worked hard and made personal sacrifices to care for us financially when I was young. That there had been a few occassions that he'd been very nice to me. Like going into a shop and buying me a top he knew I wanted for my 16th Birthday. Buying me a computer, working with me on computer projects early on, buying us both laptops, teaching me to shoot and fish, and by his having special nicknames and greetings for me, etc.. I told mom that was how dad expressed his love. My mother said, That's interesting because I always had the impression that he didn't care about you at all. I was also emotionally abused by my father, it was different than my mother's abuse though. My dad alwsys had to be the best. He could not stand for me to be good at anything I could never, ever be as good as he was or (god fobid it) better. My parents were never involved in our education. They basically just asked us at dinner how school was and we'd say OK and dinner would proceed. I should have known from past events not to dare say anything positive had happened but one day I was happy and excited about something that had happened at school, in English class. I was so excited that I stupidly spoke up at dinner. When the standard, How was school? question was asked I boldly said, School was great, Mrs. G, my English teacher pulled me aside after class. She told me a poem I'd written for an assignment was so good they want my permission to publish it on the first page of the student yearbook! My father put his fork down, he tilted his head, gave me a bizarre look and told me to recite the poem. I could not recite it, I was too nervous and afraid. I said I would show it to him after dinner, it was no big deal. No, dad wanted to hear this fabulous poem I had written, right then. I went and got the poem and started to read it out loud. Dad told me to give it to him to read. He told me if it was in the yearbook people woukd be reading it for themselves. Dad read it silently and then while scoffing and half laughing he read it aloud. Dad asked me if the idiots at my school really thought that was good writing? He said he bet he could write something right then that would be a hundred times better. Dad left the table and went to his desk while we all sat at the table waiting for his return. After about twenty minutes Dad cheerfully returned, poem in hand. He stood and read it to us. It was some lame poem with Brother can you spare me a dime as one of the lines. Dad then told us, See, that's a poem, that's what good poetry is like! After that he asked all of us, Wasn't my poem better, a lot better? We all agreed, and lied and said his poem was a lot better. I told the English teacher not to let them use my poem for the yearbook. I never wrote another poem or much else for that matter. That crap happened in 1975 and I am still not over it despite counseling. Another thing that was a form of emotional abuse was the family hierarchy. My father came first, then my sister or mother, then me. I.always came last, even though I was the eldest child. There was this thing with the food. If we had any serving size type of meat it came into play. Let's say it is steaks for dinner, they are on a platter. The largest steak is for Dad, younger sister gets the next largest, mom third largest and smallest was for me. It was like that with all of the food. It was an unwritten rule. I decided to challenge it once when the platter of Hamburgers was beside me. I knew better than to go for the one for Dad but tried to take the secind largest one. My mom was immediately shrieking at me, No, no, put that back, it's for your sister! Yours is the small one. My parents home has our family pictures hanging in the study, they are hung vertically on one wall. The order is from top to bottom, a picture of my dad, a picture of my mom, a picture of my sister, a picture of my son, then a picture of me. I.am at the very bottom, like always. I.endured physical, emotional and mental abuse. I've seen therapist on occasion over the years and at one point was in therapy sessions twice a week for a year. It helped but it hasn't enabled me forget. I just have to deal with what happened and move forward. I'm not social, I don't really trust anyone or have any close friends but I'm okay with that. TLDR: Emotionally abused, made me tough, I survived it with a bit of therapy. Edit: Added TLDR",1
"It's an interesting thing. You have to feel that you're important regardless of what anybody feels at least that was the message that people gave to me (non verbal). I mean, when I was in HS I didn't feel important. I didn't have any friends or relationships and I thought me not finding work in HS was the main cause of that. These days, I have a job and i'm in college working on a STEM degree...Still no friends or relationships...not even a sign that anyone is interested. I have to find importance in myself first and I come before everyone period because there is a good chance that I will die before anybody chooses to realize that I exist.",1

My boyfriend said this to me more frequently in the past and after YEARS of explaining why this is not a good response, he's slowly using it less, but when it pops up, my typical counter is That does not help me/make me feel better at all, and that typically shuts him up or at least makes him think about what he just said. In any case, I'm sorry you had that shitty non-reason response thrown at you. What you're going through is real and valid, even if others choose not to acknowledge it.",1
I haven't had human affection for 16years.,1
Tell us a bit more. What's your story?,0
"I know the feeling. I had a girlfriend until May of this year, and part of me regrets breaking up with her even though we weren't meant for each other. Part of me wants to be in a relationship, and the other part thinks it would be a terrible idea and that I should be alone for the rest of my life. Admittedly, it is partly just because I'm lonely, which isn't a great thing for me to build a relationship on.",1
Uhhh... who? Sorry I can't help you very much...,1
I had a dream a while back that someone had a gun pointed to my head and I told them to to pull the trigger because they would be doing me a favor.....,1
"It's certainly possible your injury could have triggered a depressive episode, especially if it's impacting something you care a lot about doing. Or a possible side effect of a new medication? Like, I was given Vicodin after a medical procedure a couple years ago but I had to stop taking it because it mostly just made me feel groggy and withdrawn.",1
"It isn't easy to deal with feelings of wishing we were dead, somehow escaping this world will resolve our matters. I tried taking my life multiple times as a teenager and always felt neglected and still do. Not a day goes by where I don't think how the world and people around me would be different if I was gone, either for better or for worse. I always try to remind myself that I keep myself on this planet to make the world a better place than I left it, as much as I want to leave the world right now, I fear we would just be losing to the enemy.",1
"No, that's what I'm doing and it isn't working.",1
Do you want to tslk to someone? I know this feeling really well.,1
Very sorry to hear it. She came back the first time?,1
"This stuff all exists on a spectrum, so maybe arriving at some place of being totally better is not what it seems. I've had hardcore depression for many years, but I have definitely moved the bar significantly (without meds and without getting what i want in life or something, like a great relationship) which I can confirm especially in the moments when my external circumstances are going terribly, but i dont fall into 6 months of suicidal morbidity. I see depression (speaking only for myself here) as a product of thoughts and meanings. The same thing can happen to two people, and a depressed person will give it an incredibly dark meaning, whereas a non depressed person might give it a neutral or positive one. To me, growth out of depression is when you are finally grasping the arbitrary nature of meaning, and the impersonal nature of thought, and can start to make conscious rather than automatic decisions about what kind of meanings and thoughts you feed and go with (even arbitrarily). So, I arbitrarily decide to look at failing as good, because it gives me good reference experiences, rather than as evidence that i am worthless. Things like that. I still struggle a lot, but there is overwhelming evidence that you can slowly climb out of the hole with very hard inner work, and that the things that would have previously sent you down the spiral become more like non issues. Meditation is the single most powerful tool i've found.",1
I'm very proud of you too! Remember the great feeling of success you have right now it will help you next time you have the urge.,1

"It is. It's very tough to keep going. I can't tell you how to make it stop, I wish I could. I just try to focus on the next very small thing I can do. I'm sorry dude. You aren't alone, I promise.",1

Mirtazapine makes me incredibly sleepy. I take it about an hour before I want to sleep and be out like a light by then.,1
"Yeah, I just took my midterms and it's worst I've ever done on any group of tests. It sucks because I feel like even if I studied way more it wouldn't have made a difference. What kind of exams do you have going on?",1
"Same here, nice to know that not alone. I have no friends at school, I hate school to be honest, it makes me feel so depressed and lonely. My home much better because my mother is always mean, my father very kind either. This place has made me meet a bunch of people I can relate to. so nice to talk to someone who understands, it makes you feel less lonely, a great feeling.",1
I'm a little lite in that area too.,1

No real job. I've have cash in hand stuff. Last job looked promising but I said I didn't want to do cash anymore as it's illegal and they didn't call me back at all.,1
"Absolutely. Self doubt, drifting thoughts, bleak view of the future, and a tsunami of regret floods my mind regularly every evening. Then I retreat to the Internet which keeps me up all night. It's a little out there, but I've had incredible relief from my insomnia, depression, and chronic pain using an Aerial Yoga Hammock. I hang it from the ceiling right next to my bed/computer desk and usually just cacoon in it for an hour or so. Feeling weightless and swaying back and forth has an incredibly natural calming effect on the mind. They are only $60 on amazon too. Feel better my friend, you are not alone.",1
"But also the majority of parasites are not pathogenic and relatively harmless to humans. A parasite such as a tapeworm for example cannot take enough nutrition from a person to drastically physically harm them. How do we get rid of parasites? Medical help is usually necessary - if it is available I would recommend it, I know it may be daunting but it could really help. There are also other options - try and find coping methods that work for you, and there is always support here and someone to talk to; feel free to send me a PM if you ever want. Keep holding on friend.",1
Is it the feeling or the visual that eases you?,0
All I want and need after I move on from this life is to be Omnipotent. It's something I obsess over because I want to experience true freedom and true peace for eternity! I just want to be a God and play in my own sandbox.,0

"That's a pretty profound question, but I think happiness is something that a lot of people don't understand. In a period or prolonged period of despair, I don't believe there can be happiness at all, and it's only after that period has been solved, over, attacked enough by effort and time, that you can start experiencing happiness. I don't think happiness and gratitude should be forced, or you should try to feel happy when you truly cannot feel happy. I'm still going through that period, and there might be rivets or jewels of happiness along the way, but they are fleeting and leave very quickly. The whole reason why people despair is because they are tied so strongly to negative emotional memories that they outweigh any trivial positive emotional memories. Think about it, which memories are the quickest, strongest, and most easily able to be remembered for you? The most emotional ones. If your most emotional memories are negative, you will be in despair. On the converse, if one's most emotional memories are positive, you will be in a state of happiness. There is a way to end your despair, you just have to face it head on and let go of everything, and keep trying to let go and accept. Very few people have any science on this and might be the thing we need to explore the most as a society as a whole.",1
"No, because I don't know what I can do to make it better. Although the motivation and concentration doesn't help.",1
never lost weight from the medications but some are known to cause little to no weight gain. Stay away for the older class of antidepressants because the cause heavy weight gain. Avoid SSRIs and try to stick to SNRIs. Bupropion is the only med linked to weight loss. Medications such as Viibryd and Pristiq have little little no side effects of weight loss.,1
"Pick something you're interested in. Anything. It could be comics, a historical event, a tv show, law, place, a band, etc and learn everything you an about that topic. See where it takes you :)",0
"true happiness is, for me, is acceptance of how sad the world is and knowing that you're truly making it better for the people in your reach. Making it better for your loved ones and friends and that includes yourself. Don't think i could ever be 100% happy, that's just being naive.",1
"I bite on my tongue for that reason. No risk of hurting yourself seriously if you pay attention, just hurts",1
You would have to be a horrible person to not deserve being liked.,0
i'm certain there's a science behind the calmness i feel in water. i've heard things about flowing water making people with anxiety feel better and i often notice it myself.,1
You aren't too much they are just assholes for leaving you. its horrible for them to just leave you when you are struggling because they don't feel like being supportive. You will find friends who care. Sometimes friends come out and tell you that you can talk to them about anything you just need to find the right people.,1
"god damn i honestly feel the exact same as you in every aspect. sometimes i also just sit back and think about how none of this feels real, then the suicidal thoughts come on because i feel like there has to be more, then more sad, more depersonalized, and its just a vicious cycle. nothing matters, but we should at least live to the fullest, because in relative terms it matters. no idea how to do that though",1
"Sometimes, I feel like this is okay though. The not being okay. I think there's this expectation we all have just because everyone else and everything around us shows this picture perfect life that is normal. Also, I get to the opinion sometimes that when none of it matters, it's actually the most liberating, because then I am truly free of my worldly concerns. I don't know. Silver lining and framing and all that jazz. Best of luck, friend.",1

"I lose my will to draw a lot when yhings are rough. I have to force myself to pick up a pen / pencil some days, or I won't produce anything for months. There isn't always a reason, I just feel down sometimes, you know?",1
"Thought I should write something since the posts you were getting didn't look helpful. It is hard not to kick yourself when you feel that you never took a chance to be with someone you thought was the one, especially when you consider them to be such a great person. I mean, how can people not blame it all oneself if the other person is what we see as nothing but good? It is points in our life like these that we carry with us that tend to weigh us down in life, these moments of regret that can build up over time that we can't move forward.",1
"That is great, keep feeling good!",1
"Heya buddy, i can relate, After 18 years of struggling I finally found out I have dyslexia, fine motor control issues and short term memory loss. It was like I had been designed to be the perfect malfunction so I cant do academics. I am different but I'd rather be dead then looked down upon by some other idiot who can do things I can't. I can do something better then they can, know how to go through hard times and keep pushing. When life gets hard for them they will break, and I won't be there to help them. Don't worry about other people, they will become dust while you will become a diamond. My question to you is, how are you going to move forward?",1
Does you happiness rely on other people's behavior?,0
"not really, people just say it does, as they want you to stay alive because theyre selfish",0
you just happen to be. get as much joy as you can.,0
"I can relate. Been a third wheel in many friendships, always feels like I'm someone people hang around instead of hang with. I even had a friend invite me over and told me he called everyone else first, but nobody was free, so guess it was time to call me. I know he didn't mean it that way, but what a shitty thing to say. Everyone else more important than you was busy, so you (bottom of the list) will have to do. It hurts and depression makes it hurt x100. Gotta find a way to prove to yourself that you are worth spending time with. I'm struggling with this pretty badly too so I wish you the best.",1
"Right there with you today.. stay strong, got this.",1
"Depends what you mean by get caught. Someone would have to report it to police to move you anywhere or if you're under 18 parents can take you to a hospital. Basic detainment is 72 hours (3 days) To ensure you're not a harm to yourself or others. During that time they examine you and see your mental state. If at the end you're not showing signs of danger you are released but given options to stay for further treatment. If you are still a danger you stay and get more treatment. Now say you made an attempt and go to the ER for something, they can't always just detain you. I've been to the ER for atempt of suicide by oversosing on medication. Longest I was there was a few hours. Due to my mental state being stable they had no legal way to hold me loner than I wanted to be there. I got the drugs out of my system then was discharged and went home. There is a ton, a shit ton of misinformation and propaganda around mental illness. Be informed, do real research. isn't google. You are smart enough to do real research don't just ask strangers online for all the answers. Also get help.",1
"Talk to your teacher. Sometimes they're willing to give extra credit if you do additional assignments or labs. Also, many teachers will at least pass a student if the student goes to them and shows that they're really making an effort in the class. One test will not ruin your life. I promise. :)",1
I feel like there might just be an in-between as well. Where someone might not care about you much but not mind being with you some/most of the time. Or is this a neutral-positive perspective?,0
That's a familiar feeling. Talk it out. What's up?,1
"Here is the thing. If you open up to these people and they through it in your face right after, then you know they aren't real friends. A real friend is willing to sit through peoples problems for hours. I once sat and chatted with a friend about his issues for some 7 odd hours hours just talking till 7am, never gave up on the conversation, he did the same for me a while later down the road when I was having problems. People who aren't willing to talk to you and help you aren't worth keeping around. Believe me there is a friend out there who is willing to listen. I guess do keep in mind that not everyone has infinite patients and has their own problems. good luck out there man hope things go well for you. (This isn't to say you can't have acquaintances, people you hang out with, but never get deep)",1
Or play video games or eat or smile or think coherent thoughts or think of reality as real. Depression can really sap the life out of you and is really hard to communicate to someone who has not experienced it.,1

"I probably would have considered bringing harm to myself and others if not for writing. Do you write? I find it helpful to seal away any self-detrimental desires inside characters who are not me. If you purge all of your thoughts out of your head and onto the page, you might find some relief. Literature is one of the most important inventions for resolving issues and you may find purpose through writing for yourself. My life is not pleasant by any means so I created the life that I want in my writing. My life became better through writing. What ideas and notions could be lost if you left us so soon? What adventures could you go on in your own book? Think of all the memories that could be shared. You could even write about a role-model. Mine is Typhon, the Greek dragon under the mountain. I obsess over this mad titan to keep myself calm. He shows up in all of my work. My advice would be to pound that pain out into a character, a mighty simulacrum, an indestructible artifact to contain your every fear. I'm not sure if I'm phrasing this well enough to help, but this is the only way I know how to express myself.",1
People barely notice me too,1
"I see what you mean, but imagine being 26, living at home with no job, absolutely no way to pay for school, and no girlfriend? I'm 26 with a decent job and live alone with no girlfriend.
